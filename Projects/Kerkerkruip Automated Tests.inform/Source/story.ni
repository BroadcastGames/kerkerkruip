[We need to end the turn after a menu, otherwise no rules run.]

After reading a command when menu question mode is true:
	follow the menu question rules;
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the exit outcome:

Chapter - test steps

Section - Properties

A test step is a kind of value. Some test steps are defined by the Table of test steps.
A test step has a stored action called the scheduled action. The scheduled action of a test step is usually the action of waiting.
A test step has a test step called the next move. The next move of a test step is usually normal keyboard input.

A test step can be repeatable. A test step has a number called the maximum repeats. The maximum repeats of a test step is usually 100. A test step can be uneventful.

Table of test steps
test step
normal keyboard input

A test step has a text called the maxed out report. The maxed out report of a test step is usually "[The scheduled event] repeated [repeated moves] times without resolution."

A test step can be generated.

Section - Enabling screen effects when testing is done

Initial scheduling of normal keyboard input:
	now allowing screen effects is true.
	
Section - Scheduling

To decide whether testing (T - a test step):
	decide on whether or not the scheduled event is T;

To decide whether testing (D - a description of test steps):
	Repeat with T running through D:
		decide on whether or not testing T;

The repeated moves is a number that varies;

The scheduled event is a test step that varies. The scheduled event is the normal keyboard input.

Initial scheduling rules are a test step based rulebook.

Initial scheduling for a test step (this is the reset act counts rule):
	repeat with guy running through people:
		now the act count of guy is 0;
			
To schedule (the event described - a test step):
	transcribe and restart capturing;
	if the event described is not the scheduled event:
		now the scheduled event is the event described;
		if the event described is normal keyboard input:
			transcribe and stop capturing;
			say line break;
			start capturing text;
		otherwise:
			log "  next step:  [the event described]";
		follow the initial scheduling rules for the event described;
		now the repeated moves is 0;
	otherwise:
		transcribe and stop capturing;
		start capturing text;
		increment the repeated moves;
	now the event described is not generated;
	transcribe and restart capturing;
	
Before taking a player action when the scheduled event is generated:
	stop and save event description;
	Let repeat be whether or not (the scheduled event is repeatable) and (the repeated moves > 0);
	now the scheduled event is not generated;
	say " .[run paragraph on]";
 	start capturing text;
	follow the testing effects rules for the scheduled event;
	transcribe and stop capturing;
	Let repeat be whether or not the scheduled event is [still] repeatable;
	if repeat is true and the repeated moves is not less than the maximum repeats of the scheduled event:
		now repeat is false;
		if the scheduled event is uneventful:
			record success of the scheduled event;
		otherwise:
			assert "[the maxed out report of the scheduled event]" based on false;
			Repeat with the attempt running through not achieved possible randomized outcomes:
				assert "After [the scheduled event], [the attempt] was still not tested" based on false;
	if repeat is true:
		schedule the scheduled event;
	otherwise:
		schedule the next move of the scheduled event;
	
Section - Generating Actions

For taking a player action when the scheduled event is not the normal keyboard input (this is the test step player action rule):
	if the player is at-React:
		follow the choosing a player reaction rules;
	otherwise:
		generate a player action of the scheduled action of the scheduled event;
		now the scheduled event is generated;
		
The test step player action rule is listed before the parse command rule in the for taking a player action rulebook.
		
A test step has an object called the location-target.

To decide which room is the action-destination of (current move - a test step):
	Let the current destination be the location-target of the current move;
	if the current destination is nothing, decide on Null-room;
	if the current destination is a room, decide on the current destination;
	decide on the location of the current destination.

The delayed action is a stored action that varies. The delayed action is the action of waiting.

For taking a player action (this is the move to the destination of a test step rule):
	if the player is at-React:
		make no decision;
	Let the place be the action-destination of the scheduled event;
	if the place is the location:
		transcribe and restart capturing;
	if the place is Null-room or the place is the location:
		make no decision;
	Let the way be the best route from the location to the place;
	if the way is not a direction:
		record failure of the scheduled event with message "No available route from [the location] to [the location-target of the scheduled event] (in [the place])";
		make no decision;
	generate a player action of the action of going the way;
		
The move to the destination of a test step rule is listed before the test step player action rule in the for taking a player action rulebook.

Choosing a player reaction is a rulebook. The choosing a player reaction rules have default success.

[I7 names borrowed from Ron Newcomb's Original Parser]
The action in progress is an action name that varies. 
The person requesting is a person that varies. 
The action in progress variable translates into I6 as "action".
The person requesting variable translates into I6 as "act_requester".

To begin the current action: (- BeginAction(action, noun, second); -)

To generate a player action of (the desired action - a stored action):
	transcribe "Player action: [the desired action]";
	now the action in progress is the action name part of the desired action;
	now the person asked is the actor part of the desired action;
	[now the person requesting is nothing;] [not allowed in I7?]
	if the person asked is not the player, now the person requesting is the player;
	now the noun is the noun part of the desired action;
	now the second noun is the second noun part of the desired action;
	begin the current action;
	
The compelled action is a stored action that varies. The compelled action is the action of waiting.

To compel (the desired action - a stored action):
	Let the guy be the actor part of the desired action;
	transcribe "compelling [the desired action][if the guy is asleep] and waking up [the guy]";
	now the guy is not asleep;
	Now the compelled action is the desired action.
	
A Standard AI rule for a person (called P) (this is the compel an action rule):
	if P is at-Act and the actor part of the compelled action is P:
		try the compelled action;
		now the compelled action is the action of waiting;
		rule succeeds.
	
The compel an action rule is listed before the insane people attack themselves rule in the standard AI rulebook.
	
[A last AI action selection rule for an at-Act person (called P) when the compelled action is not the action of waiting:
	unless P is the actor part of the compelled action, make no decision;
	blank out the whole of the Table of AI Action Options;
	choose a blank row in the Table of AI Action Options;
	now the Option entry is the compelled action;
	now the Action Weight entry is 1000;
	now the compelled action is the action of waiting.]

Last choosing a player reaction:
	generate a player action of the action of waiting.

testing effects rules are a test step based rulebook.

Chapter - Test Sets

A test set is a kind of value. null-test is a test set.

A test set can be isolated.

Definition: A test set (called the procedure) is enabled:
	If no test set is isolated, yes;
	decide on whether or not the procedure is isolated.

Definition: the null-test is enabled: no.

A test set has a test step called the first move. The first move of a test set is usually normal keyboard input.

The current test set is a test set that varies.

To decide what number is (T - a test set) as a number: (- {T} -);
To decide what test set is (T - a number) as a test set: (- {T} -);

Done testing is a truth state that varies.

To decide whether testing (T - a test set):
	if done testing is true, no;
	decide on whether or not the current test set is T;

First when play begins (this is the run all tests rule):
	write "Test transcript for Kerkerkruip.[line break]" to file of test transcript;
	initialize test steps;
	start the next test;
	transcribe and restart capturing text;
	if done testing is false:
		Now the current unit test name is "[the current test set]";
		log "Now testing [the current test set].";
		consider the scenario rules;
	otherwise:
		transcribe and stop capturing.

The random seed rule is listed before the run all tests rule in the when play begins rules.
	
To decide which test set is the initiator of (the event -  a test step):
	Repeat with the candidate running through test sets:
		if the event is the first move of the candidate, decide on the candidate;
	Decide on the null-test.
	
To initialize test steps:
	Let the current set be the null-test;
	Let the last event be normal keyboard input;
	Repeat with the next event running through test steps:
		Let the new test set be the initiator of the next event;
		if the new test set is not the null-test:
			now the current set is the new test set;
		otherwise if the last event is not normal keyboard input:
			now the next move of the last event is the next event;
		now the last event is the next event;
	
Last when play begins (this is the start the next test rule):
	if done testing is false:
		consider the test play rules;
		schedule the first move of the current test set;
	
The scenario rules are a rulebook.

The test play rules are a rulebook.

Chapter - Randomized Events

A randomized outcome is a kind of value. boring lack of results is a randomized outcome.

A randomized outcome can be achieved.

Event resolution relates various randomized outcomes to one test step. The verb to result from (he results from, they result from, it is required, it is resulting from) implies the event resolution relation.

The outcome being tested is a randomized outcome that varies.

Definition: a randomized outcome is possible if it results from the scheduled event;

To decide whether (O - a randomized outcome) became the/-- possibility:
	if O is not achieved and O is possible:
		now the outcome being tested is O;
		yes;
	no.
	
To mark the/-- outcome as/-- achieved:
	[say "achieved outcome [the outcome being tested].";]
	now the outcome being tested is achieved;
	
testing effects:
	unless a randomized outcome is possible, make no decision;
  	follow the randomized outcome testing rules;
	if every possible randomized outcome is achieved:
		record success of the scheduled event;
	otherwise:
		now the scheduled event is repeatable;

randomized outcome testing is a rulebook.


Chapter - The assert phrase (in place of Chapter - The assert phrase in Simple Unit Tests by Dannii Willis)

The test assertion count is a number variable.
The total assertion count is a number variable.
The assertion failures count is a number variable.

[ Assert that two values are the same ]
To assert that/-- (A - a value) is (B - a value):
	assert that A is B with label "value";
	
To assert that/-- (A - a value) is (B - a value) with label (T - an indexed text):
	record a test attempt;
	unless A is B:
		Let error_msg be an indexed text;
		now error_msg is "Expected [T]: [B], Got: [A][line break]";
		record a failure report of error_msg;

To assert truth of/-- (C - a truth state) with message (T - an indexed text):
	record a test attempt;
	unless C is true:
		record a failure report of T;
	
To assert (T - an indexed text) based on (C - a truth state):
	assert truth of C with message T;
	
To record a/-- success of (E - a test step):
	now E is not repeatable;
	assert truth of true with message "success."

To record a/-- failure of/-- (E - a test step) with message (M - an indexed text):
