Table of Test Results
Test Set (number)	Total (number)	Failures (number)	Failure Messages (indexed text)
with 100 blank rows

To record a test attempt:
	increment the test assertion count;
	increment the total assertion count;
	Let testnum be current test set as a number;
	if there is a test set of testnum in Table of Test Results:
		choose row with test set of testnum in Table of Test Results;
	otherwise:

Chapter - Turn-based Events

A turn-based event is a kind of value. normal keyboard input is a turn-based event.
A turn-based event has a stored action called the scheduled action. The scheduled action of a turn-based event is usually the action of waiting.
A turn-based event has a turn-based event called the next move. The next move of a turn-based event is usually normal keyboard input.

A turn-based event can be repeatable. A turn-based event has a number called the maximum repeats. The maximum repeats of a turn-based event is usually 100. A turn-based event can be uneventful.

The repeated moves is a number that varies;

A turn-based event has a text called the maxed out report. The maxed out report of a turn-based event is usually "[The scheduled event] repeated [repeated moves] times without resolution."

A turn-based event can be generated.

The scheduled event is a turn-based event that varies. The scheduled event is the normal keyboard input.

Initial scheduling rules are a turn-based event based rulebook.

Initial scheduling for a turn-based event (this is the reset act counts rule):
	repeat with guy running through people:
		now the act count of guy is 0;
			
To schedule (the event described - a turn-based event):
	transcribe and restart capturing;
	if the event described is not the scheduled event:
		follow the initial scheduling rules for the event described;
		now the repeated moves is 0;
	otherwise:
		increment the repeated moves;
	now the event described is not generated;
	now the scheduled event is the event described;
	transcribe and restart capturing;
	
Before taking a player action when the scheduled event is generated:
	stop and save event description;
	Let repeat be whether or not (the scheduled event is repeatable) and (the repeated moves > 0);
	now the scheduled event is not generated;
	if repeat is true:
		say "* [run paragraph on]";
	otherwise:
		log "testing effects of [the scheduled event]";
	start capturing text;
	follow the testing a turn-based event rules for the scheduled event;
	transcribe and stop capturing;
	Let repeat be whether or not the scheduled event is [still] repeatable;
	if repeat is true and the repeated moves is not less than the maximum repeats of the scheduled event:
		now repeat is false;
		if the scheduled event is uneventful:
			record success of the scheduled event;
		otherwise:
			assert "[the maxed out report of the scheduled event]" based on false;
	if repeat is true:
		schedule the scheduled event;
	otherwise:
		schedule the next move of the scheduled event;
	
Choosing a player reaction is a rulebook. The choosing a player reaction rules have default success.

For taking a player action when the scheduled event is not the normal keyboard input (this is the turn-based event player action rule):
	if the player is at-React:
		follow the choosing a player reaction rules;
	otherwise:
		generate a player action of the scheduled action of the scheduled event;
		now the scheduled event is generated;
		
The turn-based event player action rule is listed before the parse command rule in the for taking a player action rulebook.
		
[I7 names borrowed from Ron Newcomb's Original Parser]
The action in progress is an action name that varies. 
The person requesting is a person that varies. 
The action in progress variable translates into I6 as "action".
The person requesting variable translates into I6 as "act_requester".

To begin the current action: (- BeginAction(action, noun, second); -)

To generate a player action of (the desired action - a stored action):
	transcribe "Player action: [the desired action]";
	now the action in progress is the action name part of the desired action;
	now the person asked is the actor part of the desired action;
	[now the person requesting is nothing;] [not allowed in I7?]
	if the person asked is not the player, now the person requesting is the player;
	now the noun is the noun part of the desired action;
	now the second noun is the second noun part of the desired action;
	begin the current action;
	
The compelled action is a stored action that varies. The compelled action is the action of waiting.

To compel (the desired action - a stored action):
	Let the guy be the actor part of the desired action;
	transcribe "compelling [the desired action][if the guy is asleep] and waking up [the guy]";
	now the guy is not asleep;
	Now the compelled action is the desired action.
	
A last AI action selection rule for an at-Act person (called P) when the compelled action is not the action of waiting:
	unless P is the actor part of the compelled action, make no decision;
	blank out the whole of the Table of AI Action Options;
	choose a blank row in the Table of AI Action Options;
	now the Option entry is the compelled action;
	now the Action Weight entry is 1000;
	now the compelled action is the action of waiting.

Last choosing a player reaction:
	generate a player action of the action of waiting.
	
testing a turn-based event rules are a turn-based event based rulebook.

Chapter - Test Sets

A test set is a kind of value. Aite champions vs bat is a test set.

A test set can be isolated.

Definition: A test set (called the procedure) is enabled:
	If no test set is isolated, yes;
	decide on whether or not the procedure is isolated.

A test set has a turn-based event called the first move. The first move of a test set is usually normal keyboard input.

The current test set is a test set that varies.

To decide what number is (T - a test set) as a number: (- {T} -);
To decide what test set is (T - a number) as a test set: (- {T} -);

Done testing is a truth state that varies.

To decide whether testing (T - a test set):
	if done testing is true, no;
	decide on whether or not the current test set is T;

First when play begins (this is the run all tests rule):
	write "Test transcript for Kerkerkruip.[line break]" to file of test transcript;
	start the next test;
	transcribe and restart capturing text;
	if done testing is false:
		Now the current unit test name is "[the current test set]";
		log "Now testing [the current test set].";
		consider the scenario rules;
	otherwise:
		transcribe and stop capturing.

The random seed rule is listed before the run all tests rule in the when play begins rules.
	
Last when play begins:
	if done testing is false:
		consider the test play rules;
		schedule the first move of the current test set;
	
The scenario rules are a rulebook.

The test play rules are a rulebook.

Chapter - Randomized Events

The maximum number of random event iterations is a number that varies. The maximum number of random event iterations is 100.

A randomized event is a kind of value. boring lack of events is a randomized event.

A random outcome is a kind of value. boring lack of results is a random outcome.

A random outcome can be achieved.

Event resolution relates various random outcomes to one randomized event. The verb to result from (he results from, they result from, it is required, it is resulting from) implies the event resolution relation.

The event being tested is a randomized event that varies.

The outcome being tested is a random outcome that varies.

Definition: a random outcome is possible if it results from the event being tested;

To decide whether (O - a random outcome) became the/-- possibility:
	if O is not achieved and O is possible:
		now the outcome being tested is O;
		yes;
	no.
	
To mark the/-- outcome as/-- achieved:
	[say "achieved outcome [the outcome being tested].";]
	now the outcome being tested is achieved;
	
To test (E - a randomized event):
	now the event being tested is E;
	log "Testing random outcomes of [E].";
	Repeat with i running from 1 to the maximum number of random event iterations:
		if every possible random outcome is achieved, stop;
		follow the randomized event testing rules for E;
		follow the random outcome testing rules;
	Repeat with the attempt running through not achieved possible random outcomes:
		record a test attempt;
		let msg be indexed text;
		now msg is "After [the maximum number of random event iterations] iterations of [the event being tested], [the attempt] was still not tested.";
		record a failure report of msg;

Randomized event testing is a randomized event based rulebook.

Random outcome testing is a rulebook.

Chapter - Resetting the Game After Each Test Set (in place of Chapter - The Unit test rules unindexed in Simple Unit Tests by Dannii Willis)

The current unit test name is an indexed text variable.

To start the/-- next test:
	transcribe and stop capturing;
	Repeat with T running through enabled test sets:
		now the current test set is T;
		if the result of saving undo state is successful save, stop;
		read file of test results into Table of Test Results;

A person has a number called the act count;

A combat round rule (this is the count combat actions rule):
	increment the act count of the main actor;
	
The count combat actions rule is listed before the dreadful presence effect rule in the combat round rules.

Test play when testing Dreadful-Presence-Test:
	repeat with guy running through denizen people:

	if guy is the player and the player is not insane, decide on 0;
	let n be dreadful presence of the player;
	let m be 10 times n;
	increase m by 5;
	decrease m by final mind of guy;
	decrease m by level of guy;
	if m > 40:

	let pattern be indexed text;
	now pattern is "[The guy] cower[s] before your dreadful presence";
	if the event description matches the regular expression pattern:
		increment cower count of the guy;
	
To decide whether (guy - a person) is within (delta - a number) percent of cowering target:
	if the act count of guy is 0, decide no;
	let cower percentage be cower count of guy times 100 divided by the act count of guy;
	let percent difference be cower percentage minus the target cower percentage of guy;

Testing a turn-based event of a cower-counting turn-based event:
	Let success count be 0;
	Repeat with guy running through people in the location:
		check if guy cowered this turn;
		if guy is within 5 percent of cowering target, increment success count;	
	if the repeated moves is at least 20 and success count is the number of people in the location:
