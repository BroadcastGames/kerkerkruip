The file of test transcript is called "testtranscript".

To log (T - an indexed text):
	let currently capturing be whether or not text capturing is active;
	if currently capturing is true, transcribe and stop capturing text;
	say "[T][line break]";
	append "**** [T][line break]" to file of test transcript;
	if currently capturing is true, start capturing text;

To transcribe and restart capturing text/--:
	transcribe and stop capturing text;
	start capturing text;
	
The file of test results is called "testresults".

Table of Test Results
Test Set (number)	Total (number)	Failures (number)	Failure Messages (indexed text)
with 100 blank rows

To record a test attempt:
	increment the test assertion count;
	increment the total assertion count;
	Let testnum be current test set as a number;
	if there is a test set of testnum in Table of Test Results:
		choose row with test set of testnum in Table of Test Results;

		choose a blank row in Table of Test Results;
		now test set entry is testnum;
		now total entry is 0;
		now failures entry is 0;
		now failure messages entry is "";
	increment the total entry;
	
To record a/-- failure of/-- (msg - an indexed text):
	Let testnum be current test set as a number;
	choose row with test set of testnum in Table of Test Results;	
	increment the assertion failures count;
	increment the failures entry;
	now the failure messages entry is "[failure messages entry]Failure for test: [the current test set], assertion [the test assertion count]: [msg][paragraph break]";
	log msg;
	
To display test results:
	say "Test results:[paragraph break]";
	let grand test total be 0;
	let grand test failures be 0;
	Repeat through Table of Test Results:
		now grand test total is grand test total plus total entry;

Chapter - Test Sets

A test set is a kind of value. Aite champions vs bat is a test set.

The current test set is a test set that varies.

To decide what number is (T - a test set) as a number: (- {T} -);
To decide what test set is (T - a number) as a test set: (- {T} -);

Done testing is a truth state that varies.

To decide whether testing (T - a test set):
	if done testing is true, no;
	decide on whether or not the current test set is T;

First when play begins:
	write "Test transcript for Kerkerkruip.[line break]" to file of test transcript;
	start the next test;
	if done testing is false, consider the scenario rules.
	
Last when play begins:
	if done testing is false, consider the test play rules.
	
The scenario rules are a rulebook.

The test play rules are a rulebook.

Chapter - Randomized Events

The maximum number of random event iterations is a number that varies. The maximum number of random event iterations is 100.

A randomized event is a kind of value. boring lack of events is a randomized event.

A random outcome is a kind of value. boring lack of results is a random outcome.

A random outcome can be achieved.

Event resolution relates various random outcomes to one randomized event. The verb to result from (he results from, they result from, it is required, it is resulting from) implies the event resolution relation.

The event being tested is a randomized event that varies.

The outcome being tested is a random outcome that varies.

Definition: a random outcome is possible if it results from the event being tested;

To decide whether (O - a random outcome) became the/-- possibility:
	if O is not achieved and O is possible:
		now the outcome being tested is O;
		yes;
	no.
	
To mark the/-- outcome as/-- achieved:
	[say "achieved outcome [the outcome being tested].";]
	now the outcome being tested is achieved;
	
To test (E - a randomized event):
	now the event being tested is E;
	Repeat with i running from 1 to the maximum number of random event iterations:
		if every possible random outcome is achieved, stop;
		follow the randomized event testing rules for E;
		follow the random outcome testing rules;
	Repeat with the attempt running through not achieved possible random outcomes:
		record a test attempt;
		let msg be indexed text;
		now msg is "After [the maximum number of random event iterations] iterations of [the event being tested], [the attempt] was still not tested.";
		record a failure of msg;

Randomized event testing is a randomized event based rulebook.

Random outcome testing is a rulebook.

The event description is an indexed text that varies.

Chapter - Turn-based Events

A turn-based event is a kind of value. normal keyboard input is a turn-based event.
A turn-based event has a stored action called the scheduled action. The scheduled action of a turn-based event is usually the action of waiting.
A turn-based event has a turn-based event called the next move. The next move of a turn-based event is usually normal keyboard input.

A turn-based event can be generated.

The scheduled event is a turn-based event that varies. The scheduled event is the normal keyboard input.

Choosing a player reaction is a rulebook.

Before taking a player action when the scheduled event is generated:
	transcribe and stop capturing;
	now the event description is "[the captured text]";
	log "testing effects of [the scheduled event]";
	now the scheduled event is not generated;
	Let the completed event be the scheduled event;
	schedule the next move of the completed event;
	start capturing text;
	follow the testing a turn-based event rules for the completed event;
	
For taking a player action when the scheduled event is not the normal keyboard input (this is the turn-based event player action rule):
	if the player is at-React:
		follow the choosing a player reaction rules;
	otherwise:
		generate a player action of the scheduled action of the scheduled event;
		now the scheduled event is generated.
		
The turn-based event player action rule is listed before the parse command rule in the for taking a player action rulebook.
		
[I7 names borrowed from Ron Newcomb's Original Parser]
The action in progress is an action name that varies. 
The person requesting is a person that varies. 
The action in progress variable translates into I6 as "action".
The person requesting variable translates into I6 as "act_requester".

To begin the current action: (- BeginAction(action, noun, second); -)

To generate a player action of (the desired action - a stored action):
	log "generating [the desired action]";
	now the action in progress is the action name part of the desired action;
	now the person asked is the actor part of the desired action;
	now the person requesting is nothing;
	if the person asked is not the player, now the person requesting is the player;
	now the noun is the noun part of the desired action;
	now the second noun is the second noun part of the desired action;
	begin the current action;

Last choosing a player reaction:
	generate a player action of the action of waiting.
	
testing a turn-based event rules are a turn-based event based rulebook.

To schedule (the event described - a turn-based event):
	transcribe and restart capturing text;
	now the event described is not generated;
	now the scheduled event is the event described;
	
Chapter - The assert phrase (in place of Chapter - The assert phrase in Simple Unit Tests by Dannii Willis)

The test assertion count is a number variable.
The total assertion count is a number variable.
The assertion failures count is a number variable.

[ Assert that two values are the same ]
To assert that/-- (A - a value) is (B - a value):
	stop capturing text;
	record a test attempt;
	unless A is B:
		Let error_msg be an indexed text;
		now error_msg is "Expected: [B], Got: [A][line break]";
		record a failure of error_msg;
	start capturing text;

[ Assert that any condition is true, but with less information on failure ]
To assert that/-- (C - a condition):
	(- Assert_Condition({C}); -).

Include (-
[ Assert_Condition C;
	EndCapture();
	(+ the test assertion count +)++;
	(+ the total assertion count +)++;
	if (~~(C))
	{
		(+ the assertion failures count +)++;
		print "Failure for test: ";
		print (INDEXED_TEXT_TY_Say) (+ the current unit test name +);
		print ", assertion: ", (+ the test assertion count +), ". (Asserted condition is false)^";
	}
	StartCapture();
];
-).

Chapter - Resetting the Game After Each Test Set (in place of Chapter - The Unit test rules unindexed in Simple Unit Tests by Dannii Willis)

The current unit test name is an indexed text variable.

To start the/-- next test:
	Repeat with T running through test sets:
		now the current test set is T;
		if the result of saving undo state is successful save, stop;
		read file of test results into Table of Test Results;
	stop capturing text;
	now done testing is true;
	display test results;

For reading a command when done testing is false:
	transcribe and stop capturing text;
	write file of test results from Table of Test Results;
	restore undo state.
