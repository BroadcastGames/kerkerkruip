Section - Aite Champions vs Bat

Aite champions vs bat is a test set.

A scenario rule when testing Aite champions vs bat:
	now Bodmall is testobject;
	now mindslug is testobject;
	now Hall of Gods is testobject;
	now Drakul's lifeblood is testobject;
	now Temple of Chton is testobject;
		
[TODO: create randomized test plays
attempt rulebook does something that might make the test qualify
application rulebook check if the test applies and marks it as completed - or chooses which test to run based on attempt outcome
assertion rulebook runs the test's assertions]

A test play when testing Aite champions vs bat:
	now the player carries Drakul's lifeblood;
	extract the player to the location of Bodmall;
	have the player defeat Bodmall;
	extract the player to temple of Chton;
	have the player sacrifice a random granted power;
	assert that the favour of the player with Chton is 4;
	extract the player to the location of the mindslug;
	have the player defeat the mindslug;
	now the mind score of the player is 200;
	extract the player to Hall of Gods;
	have the player and the healer of aite fight in Arena of the Gods;
	try drinking Drakul's lifeblood;
	try turning bat;
	Repeat with guy running through people in Arena of the Gods:
		now the defence of guy is 100;

Player-targeted is a truth state that varies.
Player-damaged is a truth state that varies.

Aite spike vs bat is a test step. The first move of Aite champions vs bat is aite spike vs bat.

After taking a player action when the scheduled event is aite spike vs bat:
	repeat with guy running through people in the location:
		now health of guy is 100;
	now player-damaged is false;
	now player-targeted is false;
	
Intervention possible when the scheduled event is aite spike vs bat:
	unless the main actor is the player and intervention-god is Aite, rule fails;
	
Intervention bonus when the scheduled event is aite spike vs bat:
	if the main actor is the player, increase the intervention-bonus by 100;
	
testing effects of aite spike vs bat:
	now player-damaged is whether or not the health of the player is less than 100;
	if the event description matches the regular expression "bursts out of the ground<^[line break]>+ you":
		now player-targeted is true;
		assert that the event description includes "bursts out of the ground in front of you";
	
bat crashing into spike is a randomized outcome. It results from Aite spike vs bat.
bat avoiding huge spike is a randomized outcome. It results from Aite spike vs bat.
bat avoiding gigantic spike is a randomized outcome. It results from Aite spike vs bat.

randomized outcome testing when bat crashing into spike became the possibility:
	if player-damaged is false, make no decision;
	mark the outcome achieved;
	assert that the event description includes "crash into";
	
randomized outcome testing when bat avoiding huge spike became the possibility:
	if player-targeted is false, make no decision;
	if player-damaged is true, make no decision;
	unless the event description matches the regular expression "huge <a-z>+ bursts out of the ground in front of you", make no decision;
	mark the outcome achieved;
	assert that the event description includes "You fly over";

randomized outcome testing when bat avoiding gigantic spike became the possibility:
	if player-targeted is false, make no decision;
 	if player-damaged is true, make no decision;
	unless the event description matches the regular expression "gigantic <a-z>+ bursts out of the ground in front of you", make no decision;
	mark the outcome achieved;
	assert that the event description includes "You fly around";

Arena-tormentor-enslaving is a test step.

Choosing a player action when testing Arena-tormentor-enslaving:
	generate the action of enslaving the tormentor of Aite.
	
testing effects of Arena-tormentor-enslaving:
	assert that the event description includes "will do your bidding";
	assert that the event description includes "ball of lightning .* damage to the tormentor of Aite";
	if the tormentor of Aite is alive:
		assert that the event description includes "The tormentor of Aite prostrates herself. 'I beg for your mercy, O great Aite,' she prays. Then she rises to fight you again!";
		assert that the tormentor of Aite opposes the player;
	otherwise:
		assert that the event description includes ", killing her";

	
[TODO: test armadillo and reaper following]

Section - Armadillo wandering

armadillo-wandering is a test set.

Scenario when testing armadillo-wandering:
	now the ravenous armadillo is testobject;

waiting-for-armadillo-move is a repeatable test step. The first move of armadillo-wandering is waiting-for-armadillo-move.

armadillo-start is a room that varies.

Initial scheduling of waiting-for-armadillo-move:
	now armadillo-start is the location of the ravenous armadillo.
	
Testing effects of waiting-for-armadillo-move:
	if the location of the armadillo is not armadillo-start:
		record success of waiting-for-armadillo-move.
