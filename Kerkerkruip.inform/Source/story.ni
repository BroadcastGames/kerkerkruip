Section - 3rd Party Inclusions

[ Check https://github.com/i7/extensions if the I7 site only has older versions ]

[Include version 1/131215 of Alternative Startup Rules by Dannii Willis.]

[ This belongs in Actions, but it has to be defined before the Glimmr and Windows extensions. We should move this somewhere sensible later, and maybe use it for all the options? ]
An option is a kind of value.
The information panels are an option.



Section - Graphics and Windows

[ Disable the status line purely to prevent reverse mode from being switched on. This doesn't prevent us from opening the status line manually, which we already had to do. ]
Use no status line.

[ Testing with Glimmr installed will be slower, due to compilation and graphics, so commits to story.ni would generally best be made with it commented out. It is not necessary to comment out Flexible Windows when Glimmr is commented in. ]

Include version 15/160609 of Flexible Windows by Jon Ingold.
Include Hyperlinks by Kerkerkruip.

[Include Kerkerkruip Glimmr Additions by Erik Temple.]

Include version 1/150128 of Menus by Dannii Willis.

Attribute printed is a truth state variable. Attribute printed is false.

To check initial position of attribute:
	if attribute printed is false:
		say "You are [run paragraph on]";
		now attribute printed is true;
	otherwise:
		say ", [run paragraph on]".



[Include Kerkerkruip Start and Finish by Victor Gijsbers.]

Section - Detecting whether or not the Gargoyle config file has been applied

[ We can detect whether or not the Gargoyle config file has been applied by checking whether one of the text colours has been changed. Warning, user style 2 will be pretty ugly if it has! ]

GarGlk is an IO implementation.

To decide whether the gargoyle config file was used:
	(- DetectGargoyleConfigFile() -).

Include (-
[ DetectGargoyleConfigFile res;
	! Don't test the style in CocoaGlk because it will crash
	if ( ~~(+ CocoaGlk detection flag +) )
	{
		res = glk_style_measure( gg_mainwin, style_User2, stylehint_TextColor, gg_arguments );
	}
	return res && gg_arguments-->0 == $F400A1;
];
-).

An IO implementation detection rule (this is the test for GarGlk rule):
	if the Gargoyle config file was used:
		rule succeeds with result GarGlk;





Section - Low-level Access to Data Values

Table of Data Storage
key (number)	value (number)
--	--
with 14 blank rows

Table of Victories
Victories	Level	Best-Level
0	0	0

To decide which number is data value (X - a number):
	if there is a key of X in the Table of Data Storage:
		choose row with a key of X in the Table of Data Storage;
		decide on the value entry;
	otherwise:
		decide on 0;

To set data value (X - a number) to (Y - a number), table only (this is data-value setting):
	if there is a key of X in the Table of Data Storage:
		choose row with a key of X in the Table of Data Storage;
	otherwise:
		choose a blank row in the Table of Data Storage;
		now the key entry is X;
	now the value entry is Y;
	[if not table only:
		save data storage;]


Section - Accessing Data Values

data storage parameter is a kind of value. The data storage parameters are defined by the Table of Data Value Labels.

A data storage parameter has a number called enabled value. A data storage parameter has a number called disabled value. A data storage parameter has a number called data value index.

Table of Data Value Labels
data storage parameter	data value index	enabled value	disabled value
total victories	1	--	--
current difficulty	2	--	--
highest achieved difficulty	3	--	--
advanced content	4	1	0
main menu graphics flag	5	1	-1
session flag	6	1	0
window panels flag	7	0	1
menu hyperlinks	8	1	-1
sound	9	1	-1
screen reader mode	10	1	-1

To decide which number is (P - a data storage parameter) as a number: (- {P} -);

To decide which number is the/-- number/setting of (P - a data storage parameter):
	decide on data value (P as a number);

To decide whether (P - a data storage parameter) is/are unset:
	if disabled value of P is 0 or enabled value of P is 0, no;
	Decide on whether or not number of P is 0;

To decide whether (P - a data storage parameter) is/are enabled:
	decide on whether or not number of P is enabled value of P;

To decide whether (P - a data storage parameter) is/are disabled:
	decide on whether or not number of P is disabled value of P;

To decide whether main menu graphics is/are enabled:
	if screen reader mode is enabled, no;
	decide on whether or not main menu graphics flag is enabled;

To decide whether window panels is/are enabled:
	if screen reader mode is enabled, no;
	decide on whether or not window panels flag is enabled;

To decide whether main menu graphics is/are disabled:
	if screen reader mode is enabled, yes;
	decide on whether or not main menu graphics flag is disabled;

To decide whether window panels is/are disabled:
	if screen reader mode is enabled, yes;
	decide on whether or not window panels flag is disabled;

To increase the/-- (param - a data storage parameter) by (N - a number), table only:
	if table only:
		set param to (number of param) + N, table only;
	otherwise:
		set param to (number of param) + N;

To set the/-- (param - a data storage parameter) to (N - a number), table only:
	let P be param as a number;
	if table only:
		set data value P to N, table only;
	otherwise:
		set data value P to N;

To enable (param - a data storage parameter), table only:
	if table only:
		set param to enabled value of param, table only;
	otherwise:
		set param to enabled value of param;

To disable (param - a data storage parameter), table only:
	if table only:
		set param to disabled value of param, table only;
	otherwise:
		set param to disabled value of param;

To toggle (param - a data storage parameter), table only:
	if param is enabled:
		if table only:
			disable param, table only;
		otherwise:
			disable param;
	otherwise:
		if table only:
			enable param, table only;
		otherwise:
			enable param;
