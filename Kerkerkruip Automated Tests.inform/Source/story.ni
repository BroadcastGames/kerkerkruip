Section - Plurality fix

[Let's see whether this works.]

To decide whether (item - an object) acts plural: 
	if the item is plural-named:
		yes;

Section - Questions fix (in place of Section 4 - Processing menu questions in Questions by Michael Callaghan)

[We need to end the turn after a menu, otherwise no rules run.]

After reading a command when menu question mode is true:
	follow the menu question rules;
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the exit outcome:
		deactivate menu question mode;
		follow the every turn rules;
		follow the advance time rule;
		change the text of the player's command to "dontparse";
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the retry outcome:
		reject the player's command;
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the parse outcome:
		deactivate menu question mode.

Dontparsing is an action applying to nothing. Understand "dontparse" as dontparsing.

Carry out dontparsing:
	do nothing instead.
