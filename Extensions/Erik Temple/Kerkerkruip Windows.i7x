Section - Window styling

The back-colour of the main-window is g-white.[For CocoaGlk]

To set styles for the status window:
	set the background of the status window to colored;
	set the background color of the status window to g-header-color;
	set the text color of the status window to g-black;[just for completeness, will be the default in most Glk implementations]
	[apply bold-weight boldness to bold-style;]
	apply color (assigned number of g-humanist-crimson) to bold-style for grid windows.

To decide which special-style is normal-style:
	(- 0 -).

To open the/-- status window:
	shut down border-7-window;[just in case it's already open]
	if the status window is already open, rule fails;
	set styles for the status window;
	initialize the status window;
	place border border-7-window.

To apply color (N - a number) to (chosen style - a special-style) for grid windows:
	(- glk_stylehint_set(wintype_TextGrid, {chosen style}, stylehint_TextColor, {N}); -)

To set up styles for side windows:
	apply assigned number of g-humanist-crimson color to special-style-1;
	apply bold-weight boldness to special-style-1.


Chapter - Window-drawing rules
[There are two primary places where we need to redraw the windows. First, before reading a command should handle all in-game situations. But we also need the stats to reflect the last turn of the game when we've won, since this will most often be a combat turn that we have lost. For that, we hook into the activity for printing the player's "obituary".]

To redraw subsidiary content windows:
	follow the window-drawing rules for the stats-window;
	follow the window-drawing rules for the powers-window;
	follow the window-drawing rules for the inventory-window.

Before reading a command (this is the refresh side windows rule):
	redraw subsidiary content windows..
	
Before printing the player's obituary (this is the final refresh side windows rule):
	redraw subsidiary content windows.
