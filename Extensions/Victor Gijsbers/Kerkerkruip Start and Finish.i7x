Kerkerkruip Start and Finish by Victor Gijsbers begins here.

Use authorial modesty.

[ Start and finish takes care of:
	showing the title screen and help menu
	handling difficultly levels
	winning and losing
]


To say Kerkerkruip:
	say "[italic type]Kerkerkruip[roman type]".


Chapter - The title screen activity

Showing the title screen is an activity.

[ Show the title screen in the place of the when play begins rules ]

The show the title screen rule is listed instead of the when play begins stage rule in the startup rules.
This is the show the title screen rule:
	carry out the showing the title screen activity;

Last after showing the title screen:
	consider the when play begins rules;



Section - Detecting CocoaGlk

[ The code in the next section, for detecting the Gargoyle configuration file, runs into Inform bug 1189 under CocoaGlk.  Therefore, we need to detect CocoaGlk before attempting that test.  This code is based on https://github.com/i7/i7grip/blob/ae7df20ffcf8c1746c478a2a7a5a8fa0aecd8e5e/Low-Level%20Operations.i7x. ]

CocoaGlk detected is a truth state that varies.  CocoaGlk detected is false.

Include (-
	Array cocoaKeyWindowCheck --> 1;
	[ detectCocoaGlk
		root nonroot firstWindow secondWindow;
		! Detect CocoaGlk via Inform bug 819, without falling afoul of Inform bug 961.
		(+ CocoaGlk detected +) = false;
		! To identify bug 819 we need two related windows whose circumstances of creation we know about.
		! (So that we can be sure that one should be the key window of the other.)
		! We do not want to rely on anything the story has done previously, so we will create these windows ourselves and destroy them later.
		! Windows are created by establishing a root or by splitting, depending on whether a root already exists.
		! Therefore, test for a root.
		root = glk_window_get_root();
		if (root) {
			! A root already exists, so we must split.
			! Under 961, closing a window split off of the root without also closing the root can make the story invisible.
			! Consequently, we cannot safely split the root itself.
			! So we look for a nonroot window.
			for (nonroot = 0: nonroot = glk_window_iterate(nonroot, 0):) {
				if (nonroot ~= root) {
					break;
				}
			}
			! If we found a window to split, the loop terminated by a break and set nonroot to that window.
			! Otherwise nonroot is zero, from the end of the glk_window_iterate cycle.
			if (nonroot) {
				! Since we found a window, split it.
				firstWindow = glk_window_open(nonroot, winmethod_Below | winmethod_Proportional, 50, wintype_TextBuffer, 0);
			} else {
				! Otherwise we know that there is exactly one window open.
				! Kerkerkruip under CocoaGlk should never leave the interpreter in such a state.
				! (Under other Glk implementations, notably those that only allow one window, it may.)
				! So we conclude that CocoaGlk is not present and return.
				! (Though the return here is not strictly necessary, since no further conditionals will trigger.)
				rfalse;
			}
		} else {
			! A root does not exist, so we may create one.
			firstWindow = glk_window_open(0, 0, 0, wintype_TextBuffer, 0);
		}
		! Root creation and window splitting may fail under some Glk implementations, but not CocoaGlk.
		! If we saw a failure, we can skip the rest of this detection process.
		if (firstWindow) {
			! Now there must be a root, and we are sure that firstWindow is safe to split.
			! Split it.
			secondWindow = glk_window_open(firstWindow, winmethod_Below | winmethod_Proportional, 50, wintype_TextBuffer, 0);
			! Again, window splitting may fail under some Glk implementations, but not CocoaGlk.
			! If we saw a failure, we can skip the rest of this detection process, except for cleaning up the window we did create.
			if (secondWindow) {
				! Finally, we have our two windows whose circumstances of creation we know about.
				! We ask the Glk implementation for the key of firstWindow, expecting it to be secondWindow.
				glk_window_get_arrangement(glk_window_get_parent(firstWindow), 0, 0, cocoaKeyWindowCheck);
				! If, instead, we got a result of firstWindow, that's bug 819, and we're dealing with CocoaGlk.
				(+ CocoaGlk detected +) = (cocoaKeyWindowCheck-->0) == firstWindow;
				! Now clean up the second window.
				glk_window_close(secondWindow, 0);
			}
			! And clean up the first window.
			glk_window_close(firstWindow, 0);
		}
		rfalse;
	];
-).

The detect CocoaGlk rule translates into I6 as "detectCocoaGlk".
The detect CocoaGlk rule is listed before the virtual machine startup rule in the startup rules.

Section - Detecting whether or not the Gargoyle config file has been applied

[ We can detect whether or not the Gargoyle config file has been applied by checking whether one of the text colours has been changed. Warning, user style 2 will be pretty ugly if it has! ]

The Gargoyle config file was used is a truth state variable.

First before showing the title screen (this is the detect whether the config file has been applied rule):
	detect the gargoyle config file;

To detect the gargoyle config file:
	(- DetectGargoyleConfigFile(); -).

Include (-
[ DetectGargoyleConfigFile	res;
	if ((+ CocoaGlk detected +)) {
		rfalse;
	}
	res = glk_style_measure( gg_mainwin, style_User2, stylehint_TextColor, gg_arguments );
	if ( res && gg_arguments-->0 == $F400A1 )
	{
		(+ the Gargoyle config file was used +) = 1;
	}
];
-).



Section - The difficulty level

The difficulty is a number that varies.

Before showing the title screen:
	now difficulty is setting of current difficulty;

To set difficulty to (x - number):
	now difficulty is x;
	set current difficulty to difficulty;


Section - Player stats

[ Must be done before showing the title screen as some difficulty labels are gendered! ]
Before showing the title screen (this is the set gender rule):
	if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
		now the player is male;
	otherwise:
		now the player is female;

First after showing the title screen (this is the set up initial scores for the player rule):
	now permanent health of the player is 13;
	now melee of the player is 1;
	now defence of the player is 7;
	now body score of the player is 5;
	now mind score of the player is 5;
	now spirit score of the player is 5;
	give the player a stat bonus;
	give the player a stat bonus;
	give the player a stat penalty;
	restore the health of the player;

To give the player a stat bonus:
	let i be a random number between 1 and 4;
	if i is 1:
		increase permanent health of the player by 1;
	if i is 2:
		increase body score of the player by 1;
	if i is 3:
		increase mind score of the player by 1;
	if i is 4:
		increase spirit score of the player by 1.

To give the player a stat penalty:
	let i be a random number between 1 and 4;
	if i is 1:
		decrease permanent health of the player by 1;
	if i is 2:
		decrease body score of the player by 1;
	if i is 3:
		decrease mind score of the player by 1;
	if i is 4:
		decrease spirit score of the player by 1.



Section - Applying the difficulty

After showing the title screen (this is the apply the difficulty rule):
[	if difficulty is 0:
		increase health of the player by 5;
		increase permanent health of the player by 5;
		increase melee of the player by 1;
		increase defence of the player by 2;]
	if difficulty is 0:
		increase health of the player by 3;
		increase permanent health of the player by 3;
		increase melee of the player by 1;		
		increase defence of the player by 1;
	if difficulty is 1:
		increase health of the player by 1;
		increase permanent health of the player by 1;
		increase defence of the player by 1;
	let k be 7 + difficulty;
	repeat with guy running through monsters:
		now health of guy is (k times health of guy) / 10;
	if difficulty is greater than 2:
		let n be difficulty - 2;
		repeat with guy running through monsters:
			repeat with i running from 1 to n:
				buff guy.
			
To buff (guy - a person):
	let m be a random number between 1 and 5;
	if m is 1:
		increase melee of guy by 1;
	if m is 2:
		increase defence of guy by 1;
	if m is 3:
		increase body score of guy by 1;
	if m is 4:	
		increase mind score of guy by 1;
	if m is 5:	
		increase spirit score of guy by 1.





Chapter - Introduction Menu

[Much of this code has been stolen from Jon Ingold's Title Page.]

Figure opening figure is the file "smallercover.jpg".

Showing the text title screen is a truth state variable.

Rule for showing the title screen (this is the text title screen rule):
	shut down the status-window;[in case we've come to the menu with it open]
	display the text menu;
	while 1 is 1:
		now showing the text title screen is true;

		if the outcome of the rulebook is the start the game outcome:
			close the text menu;
			make no decision;
		otherwise if the outcome of the rulebook is the quit outcome:
			stop the game abruptly;
		otherwise if rule succeeded:

	say variable letter spacing;

A glulx input handling rule for a hyperlink-event while showing the text title screen is true (this is the intercept the main menu hyperlinks rule):
	if menu hyperlinks are enabled:
		convert the hyperlink code to the character code;
		request hyperlink input again;
		replace player input;

To close the text menu:
	clear the screen;

Started boolean is a truth state that varies. Started boolean is false.

Last when play begins (this is the introduction rule):
	say "[paragraph break]When you claimed that you were tough enough to take on Malygris single-handedly, everyone knew you had been drinking much more than was good for you. And the prince is not one to let an opportunity pass. Before you could so much as protest, his court mage opened a portal and you were shoved through. Predictably, the portal immediately disappeared. You doubt they're going to open it up again -- but at least you can try to make good on your boast and kill Malygris, the Wizard of Kerkerkruip!";
	now started boolean is true. [See section Victory message below.]

Chapter - The end

Section - Death message

Every turn (this is the player death rule):
	if the player is dead:
		unless the global attacker is the player:
			end the story saying "You were killed by [the name of the global attacker]";
		otherwise:
			end the story saying "You committed suicide. How unseemly!".


Section - Victory message

The victory message rules are a rulebook.

To decide whether the player is victorious:
	if started boolean is false:
		decide no;
	let counter be 0;
	repeat with guy running through alive not off-stage monsters:
		if the level of guy is 5:
			unless guy is player-enslaved:

	if counter is 0:
		decide yes;
	if Malygris-lover is true:
		decide yes;
	if Drakul-victory is true:
		decide yes;
	decide no.

Every turn (this is the victory rule):
	if the player is victorious:
		consider the victory message rules.

	
Last victory message rule (this is the normal victory message rule):		
	end the story saying "You have defeated Malygris! With his immense magical powers now at your disposal, it is time to teleport back to Montenoir and pay a little visit to the prince.";
	rule succeeds.

Victory message rule (this is the Nameless Horror message rule):
	if the Nameless Horror is follower:		
		end the story saying "You have won... technically. The Nameless Horror will find you soon, and your end will not be pretty.";
		rule succeeds.

Victory message rule (this is the enslaved Malygris message rule):
	if Malygris is player-enslaved:		
		end the story saying "You have turned Malygris into your slave!";
		rule succeeds.

To do the level 10 victory with (guy - a person):
	say "In slaying [the guy], you have done the impossible. You absorb its soul, and though this process leaves little of your own personality intact, your powers increase a thousandfold. Even the gods bow to you.";
	end the story saying "You reign eternally!".


Section - What happens after the obituary

First after printing the player's obituary (this is the reset prompt for death or victory rule):
	now the command prompt is the peaceful prompt.

After printing the player's obituary (this is the update the difficulty rule):
	if the player is victorious:
		increase the total victories by 1, table only;
		increase unlocking victories by 1, table only;
		increase difficulty by 1; [We want to go from easy to normal difficulty.]
		if difficulty is 1:
			say "[paragraph break][bold type]You have defeated Malygris on easy mode, proving that you understand the basics of the game! Next time, Kerkerkruip will start in normal mode. From now on, new items, monsters and locations will be available. Have fun![roman type][paragraph break]";
		if difficulty is greater than setting of highest achieved difficulty:
			set highest achieved difficulty to difficulty, table only;
	otherwise:
		unless difficulty is less than 2:
			decrease difficulty by 1;
	set current difficulty to difficulty;

Last after printing the player's obituary (this is the list unlocked stuff rule):
	if the player is victorious:
		let number-of-victories be number of unlocking victories;
		if number-of-victories > 99 or number-of-victories < 2:
			stop;
		let X be a list of objects; [We cannot repeat through objects, so:]
		repeat with Y running through rooms:
			if unlock level of Y is number-of-victories:
				if unlock hidden switch of Y is not true:
					add Y to X;
		repeat with Y running through persons:
			if unlock level of Y is number-of-victories:
				if unlock hidden switch of Y is not true:		
					add Y to X;
		repeat with Y running through things:
			if Y is not a person:
				if unlock level of Y is number-of-victories:
					if unlock hidden switch of Y is not true:			
						add Y to X;
		if X is not empty:
			say "[line break]You have [bold type]unlocked[roman type] new content:[line break][run paragraph on]";
			repeat with item running through X:
				say "* [the item] ([unlock text of item])[line break]";
			say "[line break]";


Section - The final question

[First stuff to get around an Inform 7 bug.]
Table of Literal Topics
text	topic
"new"	"new"

When play begins: 
	choose row with a final response rule of immediately restore saved game rule in the Table of Final Question Options; 
	blank out the whole row;
	choose row with a final response rule of immediately undo rule in the Table of Final Question Options; 
	blank out the whole row;
	choose a row with a text of "new" in the Table of Literal Topics;
	let new be the topic entry;	
	choose row with a final response rule of immediately restart the VM rule in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now topic entry is new;
	now final question wording entry is "start a NEW game";


Section - Lower the difficulty when restarting

First carry out restarting the game (this is the lower difficulty on restart rule):
	unless player is victorious:
		unless difficulty is less than 2:
			set difficulty to (difficulty - 1);

Kerkerkruip Start and Finish ends here.
