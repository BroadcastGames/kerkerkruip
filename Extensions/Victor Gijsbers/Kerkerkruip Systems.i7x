Kerkerkruip Systems by Victor Gijsbers begins here.

Use authorial modesty.


Volume - Systems

Test score is a number that varies.
Test result is a truth state that varies.
The test subject is a person that varies.
The test room is a room that varies.
The test object is an object that varies.



Part - Properties of rooms

[Standard set of properties:
X is connectable.
X is not connection-inviting.
X is placeable.
X is habitable.
X is treasurable.
X is vp-agnostic.
X is not consecrated.
X is civilised/religious/barren/deathly/elemental/magical/alchemical]


Section - Placement properties

A room can be connectable. A room is usually connectable. [Additional connections can be made in the last stage of making the map.]

A room can be connection-inviting. A room is usually not connection-inviting. [If connection-inviting (and connectable), all possible connections to this room will be made.]

A room can be placeable. A room is usually placeable. [Not placeable rooms are not considered during the normal dungeon creation.]

A room can be habitable. A room is usually habitable. [Monsters can be placed in it.]

A room can be treasurable. A room is usually treasurable. [Treasures can be placed in it.]

A room can be extra-accepting. A room is usually extra-accepting. [Extras can be placed in it.]

A room can be nogo. A room is usually not nogo. [Nogo rooms are not listed in exits and remember commands.]

Section - Vertical placement

[This section defines properties of rooms that affect how deep in the dungeon they are placed. It also contains the necessary rules for doing this.]

[vp-agnostic: standard
vp-underground: only underground
vp-likely-underground: probably underground
vp-above-ground: only above ground (z =>0)
vp-high: only above ground level (z>0)
vp-likely-high: more likely above ground]

Vertical placement is a kind of value. The vertical placements are vp-agnostic, vp-underground, vp-likely-underground, vp-above-ground, vp-high, and vp-likely-high.

A room has a vertical placement. The vertical placement of a room is usually vp-agnostic.

[A room can be underground or not underground. A room is usually not underground. [Underground rooms can only be placed underground, and are more likely than other rooms to be placed so.]]

A placement possible rule (this is the vertical placement possible rule):
	if considered room is vp-underground:
		if the considered-z is not less than 0:
			rule fails;
	if considered room is vp-above-ground:
		if the considered-z is less than 0:
			rule fails;
	if considered room is vp-high:
		if the considered-z is not greater than 0:
			rule fails.

A placement scoring rule (this is the vertical placement scoring rule):
	if considered room is vp-underground or considered room is vp-likely-underground:
		if the considered-z is less than 0:
			increase current room score by 0 - considered-z;
	if considered room is vp-high or considered room is vp-likely-high:
		if the considered-z is greater than 0:
			increase current room score by considered-z.
			
Section - Mood

[Mood is used during generation of the dungeon. Rooms with the same mood are more often placed together, and treasures are often placed in a room with fits their mood.]

Mood is a kind of value. The moods are civilised, religious, barren, deathly, elemental, magical, alchemical and non-mood.
A room has a mood. The mood of a room is usually barren.

A placement scoring rule (this is the link rooms with the same mood rule):
	if the mood of considered room is the mood of original room:
		[say "([considered room] has same mood as [original room])";]
		increase current room score by 2.

Section - Consecration

[Temples should be consecrated. Some powers -- such as extra praying abilities -- will only work in non-consecrated rooms.]

A room can be consecrated. A room is usually not consecrated.



Section - Collapse

First carry out going (this is the collapse rule):
	if the room noun of location collapses location:
		let X be room noun of location;
		change the noun exit of location to nothing;
		let reverse be the opposite of noun;
		change the reverse exit of X to nothing;
		say "With a huge crash, the [if noun is up or noun is down]staircase[otherwise]corridor[end if] [bold type]collapses[roman type] behind you!";
		[wait 4000 milliseconds before continuing;]
		now the retreat location is X;
		now X does not collapse location;
		now location does not collapse X.

Section - Tunnels

Tunnel is a kind of room. "A fairly nondescript tunnel." A tunnel is usually not placeable. A tunnel is usually not habitable. There is 35 tunnels.

[Note: we cannot use Dynamic Objects to create new tunnels without disabling fast route finding. (Fast route finding uses a table of rooms, and fails messily when we add new rooms to the game.) So I'm just starting out with 25 tunnels. We don't want the player to dig hundreds of tunnels anyway.]


Section - Digging and extra rooms

Digging is an action applying to one object.
Understand "dig [direction]" as digging.

Check digging (this is the dig in a direct rule):
	if noun is not a cardinal direction:
		say "You can only dig north, south, west, east, up, or down." instead.

A thing can be a digging tool. A thing is usually not a digging tool.

Check digging (this is the can only dig when carrying a digging tool rule):
	unless (the player has a digging tool or tunneling claws is adapted):
		take no time;
		say "You need a suitable tool to dig." instead.

Check digging (this is the only dig in connectable rooms rule):
	unless location is connectable:
		say "A magical force prevents you from digging." instead.

Check an at-React pc digging (this is the cannot dig as reaction rule):
	take no time;
	say "You cannot dig as a reaction." instead.

Carry out digging:
	let x be the x noun of location;
	let y be the y noun of location;
	let z be the z noun of location;
	if the space at x by y by z is free:
		if there is at least one not placed tunnel:
			let item be a random not placed tunnel;
			place item from location at x by y by z;
			say "You [if tunneling claws is adapted]quickly dig[otherwise]magically create[end if] a tunnel [noun].";
			do the dig move;
		otherwise:
			say "The laws of this place prevent further digging.";
	otherwise:
		let item be the room at x by y by z;
		if item is the room noun from the location: 
			say "There already is a passage there.";
			take no time;
		otherwise:
			if item is connectable:
				change the noun exit of the location to item; 
    				let reverse be the opposite of noun; 
    				change the reverse exit of item to the location;
				say "You [if tunneling claws is adapted]quickly dig[otherwise]magically create[end if] a tunnel [noun].";
				do the dig move;
			otherwise:
				say "A magical force prevents you from digging.".

To do the dig move:
	if the player can move:
		if the combat status is not peace and the player is not hidden:
			now the player is runner;
			repeat with X running through alive persons in the location:
				now X does not press the player;
				now the player does not press X;
				if the player is alive:
					if the faction of X hates the faction of the player:
						try X hitting the player;
				now concentration of X is 0;
			now the player is not runner;
		if the player is alive and the player can move:
			let place be the room noun of location;
			now retreat location is location;
			move the player to place;
			now the take no time boolean is false.

Last carry out looking when the location is a tunnel (this is the hint about other rooms rule):
	let K be a list of directions;
	let m be 0;
	repeat with way running through cardinal directions:
[		say "testing [way] ";]
		let x be the x way of location;
		let y be the y way of location;
		let z be the z way of location;
		if not the space at x by y by z is free:
			let place be room at x by y by z;
[			say "[place] is [way] of [location] ";]
			unless place is the room way from location:
				unless place is a tunnel:
					increase m by 1;
					add way to K;
	if m is greater than 0:
		say "There seems to be somewhat different stone [K].".




Section - Collapsing passages

Collapsing is an action applying to one object.
Understand "collapse [direction]" as collapsing.

Check collapsing (this is the collapse in a direct rule):
	if noun is not a cardinal direction:
		say "You can only collapse a passage to the north, south, west, east, up, or down." instead.

A thing can be a collapsing tool. A thing is usually not a collapsing tool.

Check collapsing (this is the can only collapse when carrying a collapsing tool rule):
	unless the player has a collapsing tool:
		say "You need a suitable tool to collapse passages." instead.

Check collapsing:
	let place be the room noun from location;
	unless place is a room:
		take no time;
		say "There is no passage there to collapse." instead;
	otherwise:
		if the location is not connectable or place is not connectable:
			take no time;
			say "A magical force prevents you from collapsing that passage." instead.

Carry out collapsing:
	let place be room noun of location;
	change the noun exit of location to nothing;
	let reverse be the opposite of noun;
	change the reverse exit of place to nothing;
	say "With a huge crash, the [if noun is up or noun is down]staircase[otherwise]corridor[end if] collapses!".


Section - Support for mapping

To decide whether the map can be shown:
	if glulx graphics is supported and glulx graphic-window mouse input is supported and glulx PNG transparency is supported:
		decide yes;
	decide no.

[Kerkerkruip's REMEMBER command uses a room's visited status to list rooms. However, we might have a need for showing rooms on the map that haven't been visited yet.]

A room can be map-revealed. A room is usually not map-revealed.

[We may need to show enemies without actually mapping the rooms they are in. We still need to reserve space on the map for necessary rooms, however, and can do so by designating rooms to be "enemy-drawn".]

A room can be enemy-revealed. A room is usually not enemy-revealed.

[It might make sense for some rooms to be drawn as if they were tunnels; these would generally be linear rooms, such as a bridge.]

A room can be tunnel-drawn. A room is usually not tunnel-drawn. A tunnel is usually tunnel-drawn.

Definition: a room (called the place) is map-ready if the place is placed and (the place is visited or the place is map-revealed or the place is enemy-revealed).

Extent-minimum-x is a number variable.
Extent-maximum-x is a number variable.
Extent-minimum-y is a number variable.
Extent-maximum-y is a number variable.
Extent-minimum-z is a number variable.
Extent-maximum-z is a number variable.

To calculate the extent of the dungeon:
	now extent-minimum-x is 100;
	now extent-maximum-x is -100;
	now extent-minimum-y is 100;
	now extent-maximum-y is -100;
	now extent-minimum-z is 100;
	now extent-maximum-z is -100;
	repeat with place running through map-ready rooms:
		let x be x-coordinate of place;
		let y be y-coordinate of place;
		let z be z-coordinate of place;
		if x is greater than extent-maximum-x:
			now extent-maximum-x is x;
		if x is less than extent-minimum-x:
			now extent-minimum-x is x;
		if y is greater than extent-maximum-y:
			now extent-maximum-y is y;
		if y is less than extent-minimum-y:
			now extent-minimum-y is y;
		if z is greater than extent-maximum-z:
			now extent-maximum-z is z;
		if z is less than extent-minimum-z:
			now extent-minimum-z is z.	


Chapter - Size

Size is a kind of value. The sizes are tiny, small, medium, large, huge and gargantuan.

A thing has a size. A thing is usually medium.

A person has a size called the base size.

Last when play begins (this is the set base size rule):
	repeat with guy running through persons:
		now base size of guy is size of guy.

Understand the size property as describing a thing.

Before printing the name of a weapon (called item):
	if item is not medium:
		say "[size of item] ".

Status rule (this is the size status rule):
	if player is not medium:
		say "Your current size is [bold type][size of the player][roman type][if size of the player is not base size of the player], and your base size is [bold type][base size of the player][roman type][end if].[line break][run paragraph on]".


[Note: sizes of a person are meant to reflect how big they themselves are. Sizes of objects are meant to reflect for what size person they were meant. Thus, a 'medium dagger' is much smaller than a 'medium bed': both are normal-sized objects as they are made for normal-sized humans. A huge dagger might be about the same size as a medium sword -- it would just be hard to handle for a medium person, because the hilt would be too big to grip with a hand!]

The standard measure is a medium thing. [You can test the size difference of the standard measure and X.]

To decide which number is the size difference of (a - a thing) and (b - a thing):
	if a is medium and b is medium: [most common case, just to speed things up]
		decide on 0;
	let n be 0;
	if a is tiny:
		increase n by 2;
	if a is small:
		increase n by 1;		
	if a is large:
		decrease n by 1;
	if a is huge:
		decrease n by 2;	
	if a is gargantuan:
		decrease n by 3;
	if b is tiny:
		decrease n by 2;
	if b is small:
		decrease n by 1;		
	if b is large:
		increase n by 1;
	if b is huge:
		increase n by 2;	
	if b is gargantuan:
		increase n by 3;
	decide on n.
	
[The resulting number lies between +5 (a is tiny, b is gargantuan) and -5 (a is gargantuan, b is tiny)]

Section - Size and combat

An attack modifier rule (this is the size attack modifier rule):
	if the global defender is not medium:
		if the global defender is tiny:
			say " - 2 (defender tiny)[run paragraph on]";
			decrease the attack strength by 2;
		if the global defender is small:
			say " - 1 (defender small)[run paragraph on]";
			decrease the attack strength by 1;		
		if the global defender is large:
			say " + 1 (defender large)[run paragraph on]";
			increase the attack strength by 1;
		if the global defender is huge:
			say " + 2 (defender huge)[run paragraph on]";
			increase the attack strength by 2;
		if the global defender is gargantuan:
			say " + 3 (defender gargantuan)[run paragraph on]";
			increase the attack strength by 3.

Chance to win rule when the global defender is not medium (this is the CTW defender size bonus rule):
	if the global defender is tiny:
		decrease the chance-to-win by 2;
	if the global defender is small:
		decrease the chance-to-win by 1;		
	if the global defender is large:
		increase the chance-to-win by 1;
	if the global defender is huge:
		increase the chance-to-win by 2;
	if the global defender is gargantuan:
		increase the chance-to-win by 3.

A damage modifier rule (this is the weapon size damage modifier rule):
	if the global attacker is not medium or the global attacker weapon is not medium:
		if the global attacker weapon is not size-agnostic:
			if the size of the global attacker is:
				-- tiny:
					if the numbers boolean is true, say " - 2 (tiny attacker)[run paragraph on]";
					decrease the attack damage by 2;			
				-- small:
					if the numbers boolean is true, say " - 1 (small attacker)[run paragraph on]";
					decrease the attack damage by 1;
				-- large:
					if the numbers boolean is true, say " + 1 (large attacker)[run paragraph on]";
					increase the attack damage by 1;
				-- huge:
					if the numbers boolean is true, say " + 2 (huge attacker)[run paragraph on]";
					increase the attack damage by 2;
				-- gargantuan:
					if the numbers boolean is true, say " + 4 (gargantuan attacker)[run paragraph on]";
					increase the attack damage by 4;

An attack modifier rule (this is the weapon size attack modifier rule):
	if global attacker weapon is not size-agnostic:
		if the global attacker weapon is not a natural weapon part of the global attacker:
			let n be the size difference of the global attacker and the global attacker weapon;
			if n is less than 0:
				now n is 0 minus n;
			unless n is 0:
				let n be n times 2;
				decrease n by 1;
				if the numbers boolean is true, say " - [n] (weapon size)[run paragraph on]";
				decrease the attack strength by n.

[No chance to win rule: monsters who start using over- or undersized weapons probably deserve being clumsy.]

Section - Size of weapons

[These operations are not reversible. Better not have the player play with them!]

To increase the size of (item - a weapon):
	unless the size of item is gargantuan:
		now the size of item is the size after the size of item;
		unless item is size-agnostic:
			increase weapon damage bonus of item by 1;
			increase damage die of item by 1;
			if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
				if passive parry max of item is greater than 1:
					decrease passive parry max of item by 1;
				increase dodgability of item by 1.
	
To decrease the size of (item - a weapon):
	unless the size of item is tiny:
		now the size of item is the size before the size of item;
		unless item is size-agnostic:
			if weapon damage bonus of item is greater than 0:
				decrease weapon damage bonus of item by 1;
			if damage die of item is greater than 1:
				decrease damage die of item by 1;
			if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
				increase passive parry max of item by 1;
				if dodgability of item is greater than 0:
					decrease dodgability of item by 1.
	
A dungeon interest rule (this is the change weapon sizes rule):
	repeat with item running through not off-stage not non-treasure not carried not size-agnostic weapons:
		if a random chance of 1 in 20 succeeds:
			decrease the size of item;
			if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
				decrease the size of item;
			if generation info is true, say "* Now [item] is [size of item].";
		otherwise:
			if a random chance of 1 in 10 succeeds:
				increase the size of item;
				if a random chance of 2 in 3 succeeds:
					increase the size of item;
					if a random chance of 2 in 3 succeeds:
						increase the size of item;
				if generation info is true, say "* Now [item] is [size of item].".

Section - Other effects of size

A detection rule (this is the size increases probability of detection rule):
	let n be the size difference of (the standard measure) and (the player);
	now n is n * 3;
	increase the detection probability by n.




Chapter - Powers

A power is a kind of object.

A power can be granted. A power is usually not granted.
A power has a number called the power level. The power level of a power is usually 1.
A power has some text called the command text. The command text of a power is usually "".
A power has a text called the description.

Granting relates one monster to one power. The verb to grant (he grants, they grant, he granted, it is granted, he is granting) implies the granting relation.

Killing rule (this is the grant powers when a monster is slain rule):
	if the killer-guy is the player:
		do the absorption with killed-guy.

Every turn (this is the remove all killed monsters from play rule):
	repeat with guy running through dead not off-stage persons:
		unless guy is the player:
			do the absorption with guy.

To do the absorption with (guy - a person):
	have the guy disappear;
	if guy is grouper and guy is not group leading:
		let guy2 be a random person accompanied by guy; [Redirect absorption to group leader]
		unless guy2 is defeated individually:
			now guy is guy2;
	if guy is not group leading or group of guy has been defeated or guy is defeated individually:
		increase score by level of guy;
		now test subject is guy;
		unless absorption is stopped:
			do power transferral with the guy;
			heal fully because the guy is slain;
		do achievement awarding for the guy.

To do power transferral with (guy - a person):
	repeat with X running through powers:
		if guy grants X:
			follow the absorbing rules for X;
			now X is granted;
			let n be the power level of X;
			let Z be a list of powers;
			repeat with Y running through granted powers:
				unless X is Y:
					unless power level of Y is greater than the power level of X:
						add Y to Z;
						follow the repelling rules for Y;
						now Y is not granted;
			if the number of entries in Z is greater than 0:
				say "The violence of the absorption drives [Z with definite articles] out of your body. ";
			grant a faculty increase of n.

To heal fully because (guy - a person) is slain:
	if the level of guy is greater than 0 and the level of guy is not 10:
		unless the player is undead:
			say "Absorbing a soul has [bold type]fully healed[roman type] you.";
			fully heal the player;
		otherwise:
			say "Absorbing a soul has [bold type]restored some of your health[roman type].";
			let n be 8 times level of guy;
			heal the player for n health;
	if the level of guy is 10:
		do the level 10 victory with guy.

To have (guy - a person) disappear:
	let X be the holder of guy;
	unless X is nothing:
		repeat with Y running through things had by guy:
			move Y to X;
			if Y is a weapon:
				now Y is not readied;
	remove guy from play.


To do achievement awarding for (guy - a person):
	if level of guy is 1:
		award achievement assistant dungeoneer;
	if level of guy is 2:
		award achievement adventurer;
	if level of guy is 3:
		award achievement hunter;
	if level of guy is 4:
		award achievement destroyer.


Absorbing is a power based rulebook.
Repelling is a power based rulebook.

Section - Greatest power of the player

To decide which number is the greatest power of the player:
	let m be 0;
	if at least one power is granted:
		repeat with X running through granted powers:
			if power level of X is greater than m:
				now m is power level of X;
	decide on m.

Section - Whether absorption is stopped

The absorption stopping rules are a rulebook.

To decide whether absorption is stopped:
	consider the absorption stopping rules;
	if rule succeeded:
		decide yes;
	otherwise:
		decide no.




Chapter - Ranged weapons

[Some specials should or should not happen for ranged weapons. For instance, a heated ranged weapon does not deal extra damage.]
	
A weapon can be ranged. A weapon is usually not ranged.

Chapter - Armour-stoppable

[Armour should only reduce the damage of some weapons. For instance, armour doesn't help against a lightning bolt or dragon's fire.]

A weapon can be armour-stoppable. A weapon is usually armour-stoppable.

Chapter - Size-agnostic

[Some weapons are not dependent on the user's size for their damage output.]

A weapon can be size-agnostic. A weapon is usually not size-agnostic.


Chapter - Materials

Material is a kind of value. [The materials are other-material, iron, silver, paper, cloth, wood, glass, leather, flesh, dragon skin, stone, radiance, adamant. ][Understand "wooden" as wood.]
[
A material has some text called the material-adjective.
A material has a number called the destroying heat.
A material has a number called the corrosion resistance. [Percentile chance, because we are working with some small probabilities here -- they come up every turn, and get large quickly.]]
Heat-behaviour is a kind of value. The heat-behaviours are burner and melter. [A material has a heat-behaviour.]

The materials are defined by the Table of Materials.

Table of Materials
material	material-adjective	destroying heat	heat-behaviour	corrosion resistance
other-material	"nondescript"	5	burner	950					
iron	"iron"	10	melter	995
silver	"silver"	7	melter	985
paper	"paper"	1	burner	950
cloth	"cloth"	1	burner	950
wood	"wooden"	3	burner	970
leather	"leather"	3	burner	980
flesh	"flesh"	2	burner	900
glass	"glass"	6	melter	999
stone	"stone"	15	melter	998
dragon skin	"dragon skin"	20	burner	999
radiance	"radiant"	99	melter	1000
adamant	"adamantine"	999	melter	1000
vapour	"vapourous"	999	burner	1000

Understand the material property as describing a thing.
[Understand the material-adjective property as describing a material.]
Understand "wooden" as wood.
Understand "radiant" as radiance.
Understand "adamantine" as adamant.
Understand "vapourous" and "vapor" and "vaporous" as vapour.

A thing has a material. The material of a thing is usually other-material.
The material of a person is usually flesh.

A thing has a material called the original material.

When play begins (this is the set original material rule):
	repeat with item running through things:
		now the original material of item is the material of item.

When play begins (this is the set incorruptibility based on material rule):
	repeat with item running through things:
		if the material of item is adamant or the material of item is radiance:
			now item is incorruptible.

Before printing the name of a thing (called item):
	if material of item is not original material of item:
		if item is not proper-named:
			say "[material-adjective of material of item] ".

First after printing the name of a thing (called item):
	if material of item is not original material of item:
		if item is proper-named:
			say " (now [material-adjective of material of item])".


[Section - Test other-material - Not for Release

Last when play begins:
	repeat with item running through other-material things:
		say "WARNING: [item] doesn't have a material.".
]

Section - Silver

A damage modifier rule (this is the silver damage rule):
	if the global attacker weapon is silver:
		if the global defender is not undead and the global defender is not demonic:
			say " - 2 (silver weapon)[run paragraph on]";
			decrease the attack damage by 2;
		otherwise:
			say " + 4 (silver weapon)[run paragraph on]";
			increase the attack damage by 4;



Chapter - Attacklike behaviour

Attacking is attacklike behaviour.
Hitting is attacklike behaviour.



Chapter - Doing risky things

[Sometimes, the player can do a risky thing which should allow his enemy to make an attack of opportunity. But we do not want this to be a good way of making your enemy attack before his concentration is high enough -- so we are going to give the enemy a big to-hit bonus when the player is doing something risky.] 

[I don't think we are actually using this right now.]

A person can be risky. A person is usually not risky.

An attack modifier rule (this is the defender is doing something risky rule):
	if the global defender is risky:
		say " + 6 (defender taking risky action)[run paragraph on]";
		increase the attack strength by 6.

Chance to win rule when the global defender is risky (this is the CTW risky bonus rule):
	increase the chance-to-win by 6.




Chapter - Heat

[The heat system currently supports hotness for things. However, giving a hotness to persons is _not_ truly supported, and will lead to unwanted behaviour.]

[Much of the heat system has been turned off. It was too unituitive and punishing. Perhaps also too computation intensive?]

Section - Basics

A thing has a number called the heat strength. The heat strength of a thing is usually 0.

Definition: a thing is hot if its heat strength is greater than 0. 


Section - Feedback

Not-mentioning-hotness is a truth state that varies. Not-mentioning-hotness is false.
Not-mentioning-flaming is a truth state that varies. Not-mentioning-flaming is false.

To turn off mentioning hotness:
	now not-mentioning-hotness is true;
	now not-mentioning-flaming is true.

To turn on mentioning hotness:
	now not-mentioning-hotness is false;
	now not-mentioning-flaming is false.

Before printing the name of hot not flaming thing (called item):
	unless not-mentioning-hotness is true:
		if heat strength of item is less than 3:
			say "hot [run paragraph on]";
		otherwise if heat strength of item is less than 6:
			say "very hot [run paragraph on]";
		otherwise:
			say "blazingly hot [run paragraph on]".
		
Understand "hot" as a thing when the heat strength of the item described is greater than 0.

		if heat strength of item is less than internal heat of item:
			now heat strength of item is internal heat of item.

Section - Cooling

A thing can be a cooler. A thing is usually cooler. [If a burn check was made for an item, it will become not cooler than 1, and therefore will not cool down this turn. This stops us from having many repeated messages about something cooling down completely.]

Last every turn (this is the cooling rule):
	repeat with item running through hot not flaming things:
		unless item is not cooler and heat strength of item is 1:
			if heat strength of item is greater than internal heat of item:

Stage 1: Does anything want to prevent us from falling? PREEMPT FALLING RULE
Stage 2: Does something in the current room want to give a custom effect to falling? FIRST FALLING RULE
Stage 3: Does something in the destination room want to give a custom effect to falling? FALLING RULE
Stage 4: Otherwise, we apply standard damage in the LAST FALLING RULE.]

Falling rule (this is the move the falling person to the destination rule):

		consider the sudden combat reset rules;
	move falling-test-person to falling-destination.

Last falling rule (this is the standard deal falling damage rule):
	unless falling-test-person is flying:
		unless falling-test-person is ethereal:
			let m be a random number between 2 and 5;
			if falling-reason is 2:
				decrease m by 1; [small bonus for voluntary jumping]
			if a random chance of 1 in 10 succeeds: [make it slightly dangerous]
				increase m by 5;
			calculate the pdr for falling-guy;
			decrease m by pdr;
			if m is less than 0:
				now m is 0;
			if falling-test-person is the player:
				say "With a loud smack, you land in [the location], [if m is 0]receiving no damage[otherwise]receiving [bold type][m] damage[roman type][end if].";
				decrease health of player by m;
				now concentration of player is 0;
				now the take no time boolean is false;

			otherwise:
				decrease the health of the falling-test-person by m;
				now concentration of the falling-test-person is 0;
				if the location of falling-test-person is the location of the player and m is not 0:
					say "[The falling-test-person] receives [m] damage from the fall.";
			clean the table of delayed actions for the falling-test-person.



Chapter - Player forms

[The player can take on different forms: human-form, ghoul, vampire, vampire bat, ...

The variabel "current form" contains the current player form.

In addition, forms are either form-active or not form-active. Active forms are those that a player can switch to -- assuming we have built te code to do so, of course.]

Player form is a kind of value.

The player forms are defined by the Table of Forms.

Table of Forms
player form
human-form
ghoul-form
vampire-form
vampirebat-form

Table of Form Properties
player form		turn-text									turn-type			special rule
human-form		"You turn back into a normal human being."	living			the turn-living rule
ghoul-form		"You turn into a loathsome ghoul!"			undead			the turn-undead rule
vampire-form		"You turn into a vampire!"					undead			the turn-undead rule
vampirebat-form	"You turn into a vampire bat!"				undead			the turn-undead rule

Current form is a player form that varies.
Current form is human-form.

A player form can be form-active. A player form is usually not form-active.
Human-form is form-active.

This is the turn-living rule:
	now undead-faction hates friendly;
	now friendly hates undead-faction;
	now undead-faction hates player-enslaved;
	now player-enslaved hates undead-faction.
	
This is the turn-undead rule:
	now undead-faction does not hate friendly;
	now friendly does not hate undead-faction;
	now undead-faction does not hate player-enslaved;
	now player-enslaved does not hate undead-faction.




Section - Trumping relation

[Trumping: if A trumps B, and A is active, then when the player would turn into B, she turns into A instead. For instance, ghoul form trumps human form. If the player were to switch from vampire form back to human form, but ghoul form is active, she'll return to being a ghoul instead.]

Trumping relates various player forms to various player forms.

The verb to trump (he trumps, they trump, he trumped, it is trumped, he is trumping) implies the trumping relation. 

Ghoul-form trumps human-form.
Vampire-form trumps human-form.
Vampire-form trumps ghoul-form.
Vampirebat-form trumps human-form.
Vampirebat-form trumps ghoul-form.

[Please don't make circular trumping relations. This will lead to infinite loops.]

				now target form is X;
	unless target form is Y:
		find the trump of target form.

To turn the player into (X - a player form):
	find the trump of X;
	unless target form is current form:
		choose row with a player form of target form in Table of Form Properties;
		now current form is target form;

Carry out turning vampire:
	turn the player into vampire-form.

Turning bat is an action applying to nothing. Understand "bat" and "bat form" and "vampire bat" as turning bat.

Check turning bat:
	if vampirebat-form is not form-active:
		take no time;
		say "You do not possess that power." instead;
	if the current form is vampirebat-form:
		say "You already are in vampire bat form." instead;

Carry out turning bat:
	turn the player into vampirebat-form;
	repeat with X running through weapons enclosed by the player:
		now X is not readied;
	repeat with X running through clothing enclosed by the player:
		now the player carries X.




Chapter - Mutations

[Mutations are for use with the scroll of mutation, and maybe some other stuff. They apply only to the player.

We also put the mutation rules here, even when they do not use the mutation kind -- e.g., when they apply to properties of all people.]

Section - Mutating rules

The mutating rules are a rulebook.

The mutated boolean is a truth state that varies.
First mutating rule (this is the set mutated boolean rule):
	now mutated boolean is false.

A mutating rule (this is the mutate size rule):
	let target size be a random size;
	if a random chance of 1 in 4 succeeds:
		now target size is medium;
	if target size is not the size of the player:
		now size of the player is target size;
		now base size of the player is target size;
		say "Your body suddenly becomes [target size]!";
		now mutated boolean is true.


A mutating rule (this is the mutate gender rule):
	if a random chance of 1 in 10 succeeds:
		let n be a random number between 1 and 11;
		if n is less than 6:
			if the player is not male:
				now the player is male;
				say "You turn into a man!";
				now mutated boolean is true;
		otherwise if n is less than 11:
			if the player is not female:
				now the player is female;
				say "You turn into a woman!";
				now mutated boolean is true;
		otherwise:
			if the player is male or the player is female:
				now the player is not female;
				now the player is not male;
				say "You turn into a sexless being!";
				now mutated boolean is true.
		
			


Section - The mutation kind

Mutation is a kind of value. Some mutations are defined by the Table of Player Mutations.

Mutations can be adapted. Mutations are usually not adapted.

Table of Player Mutations
mutation		mutate-text		unmutate-text
wings		"You grow wings and gain the power of flight!"		"You lose your wings!"
darkvision	"You gain the ability to see in total darkness!"		"You lose your darkvision!"
pseudopods	"Hundreds of apparently useless pseudopods grow from your skin."		"The pseudopods that covered you disappear."
disintegrating flesh	"Your flesh loses much of ist consistency!"		"Your flesh returns to its normal solidity."
metallic scales	"Your body is covered in metallic scales!"		"The metallic scales disappear from your body."
tunneling claws	"Your hands turn into tunneling claws!"		"Your tunneling claws disappear."


Status rule (this is the mutations status rule):
	if at least one mutation is adapted:
		say "Your altered body has [bold type][list of adapted mutations][roman type].[line break][run paragraph on]".

Section - Mutating mutations

Mutations can be just-mutated. Mutations are usually not just-mutated.

A mutating rule (this is the consider mutations rule):
	let n be 3;
	while a random chance of 1 in n succeeds:
		if at least one mutation is not just-mutated:
			let perk be a random not just-mutated mutation;
			if perk is adapted:
				unmutate perk;
				now mutated boolean is true;
			otherwise:
				mutate perk;
				now mutated boolean is true;
			now perk is just-mutated;
			increase n by 2;
	repeat with perk running through mutations:
		now perk is not just-mutated.

To mutate (perk - a mutation):
	choose row with mutation of perk in Table of Player Mutations;
	now perk is adapted;
	say "[mutate-text entry][line break]".

To unmutate (perk - a mutation):
	choose row with mutation of perk in Table of Player Mutations;
	now perk is not adapted;
	say "[unmutate-text entry][line break]".


Section - Wings

A flying rule (this is the wings flying rule):
	if test subject is player and wings is adapted:
		rule succeeds.

Section - Darkvision

First blindness rule (this is the not blind if darkvision rule):
	if test subject is player and darkvision is adapted:
		rule fails.

Section - Pseudopods

[Pseudopods give a bonus to the sprout ability!]

Section - Disintegrating flesh

A damage modifier rule (this is the disintegrating flesh damage modifier rule):
	if the global defender is the player and disintegrating flesh is adapted:
		say " + 1 (disintegrating flesh)[run paragraph on]";
		increase the attack damage by 1.


Section - Metallic scales

A physical damage reduction rule (this is the metallic scales damage reduction rule):
	if the test subject is the player and metallic scales is adapted:
		increase the pdr by 1.

A damage modifier rule (this is the metallic scales damage modifier rule):
	if the global defender is the player and metallic scales is adapted:
		if the global attacker weapon is armour-stoppable:
			say " - 1 (metallic scales)[run paragraph on]";
			decrease the attack damage by 1.

Section - Tunneling claws

[Tunneling claws coded into the digging rules.]


Chapter - Blood Magic

Section - Preliminaries

A thing has a number called the blood magic cost. The blood magic cost of a thing is usually 0.
A thing has a number called the blood magic level. The blood magic level of a thing is usually 0.
A thing has a number called the blood magic maximum. The blood magic maximum of a thing is usually 0.

To decide which number is the current blood cost of (item - a thing):
	let n be (blood magic level of item) + 1;
	now n is n * (blood magic cost of item);
	decide on n.

Total blood magic is a number that varies. Total blood magic is 0.
	
Section - Feeding
	
Feeding is an action applying to one carried thing. Understand "feed [something]" and "feed blood to [something]" and "feed [something] blood" as feeding.

Check feeding:
	if blood magic cost of the noun is 0:
		say "You cannot feed [the noun]." instead;
	if blood magic level of the noun is blood magic maximum of the noun:
		say "[The noun] [is-are] satiated." instead.

Carry out feeding:
	let n be current blood cost of the noun;
	decrease health of the player by n;
	if health of the player is less than 1:
		say "You feed [n] health to [the noun], which is more than your body can handle.";
		end the game saying "Foolish people should not dabble in blood magic.";
	otherwise:
		say "You feed [n] health to [the noun], increasing [its-theirs] power[if concentration of the player is greater than 0] (and losing your concentration)[end if]!";
		increase blood magic level of the noun by 1;
		now concentration of the player is 0;
		increase total blood magic by n;
		if total blood magic is greater than 49:
			award achievement Give them blood.

After printing the name of a thing (called item) while taking inventory:
	if blood magic cost of item is not 0:
		if blood magic level of item is not blood magic maximum of item:
			say " (can be fed [current blood cost of item] blood)".
