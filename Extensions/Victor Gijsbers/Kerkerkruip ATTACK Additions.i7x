Kerkerkruip ATTACK Additions by Victor Gijsbers begins here.

Use authorial modesty.


Section - Attacking when the combat status is peace (Nomos, slaves)

[Nomos. Attack slaves.]

This is the alternative do not kill yourself rule:
	if the noun is the player and Nomos bonus is false:
		take no time;
		say "You are not that desperate!" instead.
		
The alternative do not kill yourself rule is listed instead of the do not kill yourself rule in the check attacking rulebook.

Attacking-from-peace is a truth state that varies. Attacking-from-peace is false.

This is the alternative do not attack friendly people rule:
	if the faction of the player does not hate the faction of the noun:
		if the faction of the noun is player-enslaved:
			now the noun is betrayed;
			if combat status is peace:
				now attacking-from-peace is true;
			now faction of the noun is hostile;
		otherwise:
			if the Nomos bonus is true:
				if combat status is peace:
					now attacking-from-peace is true;
				now faction of the noun is hostile;
			otherwise:
				take no time;
				say "[The noun] is your friend, not your enemy!" instead.
				
The alternative do not attack friendly people rule is listed instead of the do not attack friendly people rule in the check attacking rulebook.

The do not attack neutral people rule is not listed in any rulebook.

First check attacking:
	now attacking-from-peace is false. [If it didn't get reset for some reason.]

Last report attacking:
	if attacking-from-peace is true:
		now attacking-from-peace is false;
		now combat state of the noun is at-React;
		run the AI rules for the noun;
		now the combat status is concluding;
		consider the run delayed actions rule;
		consider the conclude the combat round rule.



Section - New rolling mechanism

[This roll creates a number between 1 and 10, but biased towards the middle values. This makes combat somewhat less random, which benefits the player and makes penalties and bonuses more important. However, we also allow a 10 to turn into a 20, so that everyone has a chance to hit everyone.

Instead of the standard 1d10 of ATTACK, we roll 1d7 + 1d4 - 1.]

The roller is a person that varies. [The guy who is rolling the dice. Used in the natural twenty rules.]
The special set attack strength rules are a rulebook. [Used for periapt of prophecy]

An attack modifier rule (this is the alternative attack roll rule):
	now roller is the global attacker;
	now the attack strength is 0;
	consider the special set attack strength rules;
	if attack strength is 0: [nothing intervened]
		now the attack strength is a roll of the dice;
	say "[italic type]Rolling ", the attack strength, "[run paragraph on]".
	
The alternative attack roll rule is listed instead of the standard attack roll rule in the attack modifier rules.

The natural twenty chance is a number that varies.
The natural twenty rules are a rulebook.

To decide which number is a roll of the dice:
	let n be a random number between 1 and 7;
	let m be a random number between 0 and 3;
	let x be n + m;
	now natural twenty chance is 0;
	consider the natural twenty rules;
	if a random chance of natural twenty chance in 100 succeeds:
		now x is 20;
	decide on x.

[1: 1/28
2: 2/28
3: 3/28
4-7: 4/28
8: 3/28
9: 2/28
10: 1/28]


[ Kerkerkruip has no reloadable weapons ]
Chapter - No reloadable weapons (in place of Chapter - Reloadable Weapons (Standard Plug-in) in Inform ATTACK by Victor Gijsbers)



Section - Losing concentration

The alternative lose concentration when hit rule is listed instead of the lose concentration when hit rule in the aftereffects rules.

The remain concentrated chance is a number that varies.
The remain concentrated rules are a rulebook.

An aftereffects rule (this is the alternative lose concentration when hit rule):
	if the the attack damage is greater than 0 and the global defender is alive:
		now the remain concentrated chance is 0;
		consider the remain concentrated rules;
		unless a random chance of remain concentrated chance in 100 succeeds:
			let the global defender lose concentration.

A remain concentrated rule (this is the damage penalty for remaining concentrated rule):
	decrease remain concentrated chance by attack damage.

Section - Killing

Last after reporting an actor hitting (this is the killing after attack rule):
	if the global defender is dead:

	otherwise:
		say "[The P] loses [bold type]concentration[roman type]!".
	
Report the player hitting a dead pc (this is the report player suicide rule):
	say "Your attack ends your own life.";
	rule succeeds;



Section - Other stuff

An AI target selection rule (this is the randomise the target result more rule):
	increase the Weight by a random number between 0 and 3;

Understand "creature" as a person.

Check switching the numbers off:
	say "The numerical representation of combat cannot be switched off in this game." instead.

After reading a command (this is the d might mean dodge rule):
	if the player's command matches "d" and the player is at-React:
		say "[italic type](Perhaps you wanted to dodge? The abbreviation for that is 'do'.)[roman type][paragraph break]".



[This could be fun, but it needs to be an option that can be set to: none, short, medium, long.]
[The non-standard attack roll rule is listed instead of the standard attack roll rule in the basic attack roll rules.

This is the non-standard attack roll rule:
	if the numbers boolean is true, say "[italic type]Rolling [run paragraph on]";
	wait 500 milliseconds before continuing, strictly;
	change the to-hit roll to a random number between 1 and 10;
	if the numbers boolean is true, say the to-hit roll, "[run paragraph on]";
	wait 500 milliseconds before continuing, strictly;.

Section - Because sometimes one can attack outside combat

[As I write this, this is only possible when the player attacks himself when commanded by Nomos.]

Chapter - Faculties

[Up to version 5, Kerkerkruip used Perception, Dexterity and Willpower. From version 6 on, we will use Body, Mind and Spirit instead. These will also be much more interesting.]

A person has a number called body score. The body score of a person is usually 5.
A person has a number called mind score. The mind score of a person is usually 5.
A person has a number called spirit score. The spirit score of a person is usually 5.

A faculty is a kind of object. body, mind and spirit are faculties.

	now test subject is guy;
	now faculty bonus score is 0;
	process the body bonus rules;
	say "[run paragraph on]";	
	process the faculty bonus rules;
	say "[run paragraph on]";

	say "[run paragraph on]";	
	decide on n.

To decide which number is the mind bonus of (guy - a person):
	now test subject is guy;

Section - Faculty increase

Unallocated faculty is a number that varies. Unallocated faculty is 0.

[The grant routine is called by power transferral in Kerkerkruip Systems.]

To grant a faculty increase of (n - a number):
	increase unallocated faculty by n;
	say "You can now increase one of your faculties by [bold type][unallocated faculty] point[if unallocated faculty is not 1]s[end if][roman type]. (Type 'body', 'mind', or 'spirit', depending on your choice.) [run paragraph on]".

Increasing body is an action out of world. Understand "body" as increasing body.
Increasing mind is an action out of world. Understand "mind" as increasing mind.
Increasing spirit is an action out of world. Understand "spirit" as increasing spirit.

Check increasing body:
	if unallocated faculty is less than 1:

Check increasing spirit:
	if unallocated faculty is less than 1:
		say "You do not have any points left!" instead.

Carry out increasing body:
	increase body score of the player by unallocated faculty;

Section - Weapon descriptions

Last report examining a weapon (this is the extra weapon info rule):
	say "[italic type]Combat statistics: 1d[damage die of the noun] + [weapon damage bonus of the noun] damage; [if weapon attack bonus of the noun is less than 0]-[otherwise]+[end if][absolute value of weapon attack bonus of the noun] attack modifier[if the noun is ranged]; ranged[end if][parry and dodge info of the noun][if the noun is silver]; good against undead and demons[end if][special weapon info of the noun][roman type].[run paragraph on][line break][paragraph break]"
