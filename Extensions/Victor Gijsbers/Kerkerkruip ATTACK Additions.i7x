[We already have:
* Melee
* Defence
* Health

Now we will add some more.]

The ability test rules are a rulebook.

Section - Perception 

A person has a number called Perception. The Perception of a person is usually 5.

To test the perception of (guy - a person) against (n - a number):
	now test subject is guy;
	now test score is a roll of the dice;
	say "[The guy] roll[s] ", test score, " + [perception of guy] (perception score)[run paragraph on]";
	increase test score by perception of guy;
	consider the perception test rules;
	consider the ability test rules;
	say " = [test score] against a target number of ", n, "[run paragraph on]";
	if test score is less than n:
		say ", failing the perception check.[run paragraph on]";
		now test result is false;
	otherwise:
		say ", succeeding at the perception check.[run paragraph on]";
		now test result is true.

The perception test rules are a rulebook.


Section - Dexterity

A person has a number called Dexterity. The Dexterity of a person is usually 5.

To test the dexterity of (guy - a person) against (n - a number):
	now test subject is guy;
	now test score is a roll of the dice;
	say "[The guy] roll[s] ", test score, " + [dexterity of guy] (dexterity score)[run paragraph on]";
	increase test score by dexterity of guy;
	consider the dexterity test rules;
	consider the ability test rules;
	say " = [test score] against a target number of ", n, "[run paragraph on]";
	if test score is less than n:
		say ", failing the dexterity check.[run paragraph on]";
		now test result is false;
	otherwise:
		say ", succeeding at the dexterity check.[run paragraph on]";
		now test result is true.

The dexterity test rules are a rulebook.



Section - Willpower

A person has a number called Willpower. The Willpower of a person is usually 5.

To test the willpower of (guy - a person) against (n - a number):
	now test subject is guy;
	now test score is a roll of the dice;
	say "[The guy] roll[s] ", test score, " + [willpower of guy] (willpower score)[run paragraph on]";
	increase test score by willpower of guy;
	consider the willpower test rules;
	consider the ability test rules;
	say " = [test score] against a target number of ", n, "[run paragraph on]";
	if test score is less than n:
		say ", failing the willpower check.[run paragraph on]";
		now test result is false;
	otherwise:
		say ", succeeding at the willpower check.[run paragraph on]";
		now test result is true.

The willpower test rules are a rulebook.


Section - Inherent damage modifier 

A person has a number called the inherent damage modifier. The inherent damage modifier of a person is usually 0.

A damage modifier rule when the inherent damage modifier of the global attacker is not 0 (this is the inherent damage modifier rule):
	say " + ", inherent damage modifier of the global attacker, " (inherent bonus)[run paragraph on]";
	increase the attack damage by the inherent damage modifier of the global attacker;


Section - Weapon descriptions

Last report examining a weapon (this is the extra weapon info rule):
	say "[italic type]Combat statistics: 1d[damage die of the noun] + [weapon damage bonus of the noun] damage; [if weapon attack bonus of the noun is less than 0]-[otherwise]+[end if][absolute value of weapon attack bonus of the noun] attack modifier[if the noun is ranged]; ranged[end if][parry and dodge info of the noun][if the noun is silver]; good against undead[end if][special weapon info of the noun][roman type].[run paragraph on][line break][paragraph break]"
			
To say parry and dodge info of (item - a weapon):
	if passive parry max of item is less than 2:
		say "; hard to parry[run paragraph on]";
	if passive parry max of item is greater than 3:
		say "; easy to parry[run paragraph on]";
	if active parry max of item is less than 2:
		say "; bad at parrying[run paragraph on]";
	if active parry max of item is greater than 3:

	if dodgability of item is less than 2:
		say "; hard to dodge[run paragraph on]";
	if dodgability of item is greater than 3:
		say "; easy to dodge[run paragraph on]".

A weapon has some text called the special weapon info. The special weapon info of a weapon is usually "".

Section - New rolling mechanism

[This roll creates a number between 1 and 10, but biased towards the middle values. This makes combat somewhat less random, which benefits the player and makes penalties and bonuses more important. However, we also allow a 10 to turn into a 20, so that everyone has a chance to hit everyone.

Instead of the standard 1d10 of ATTACK, we roll 1d7 + 1d4 - 1.]

An attack modifier rule (this is the alternative attack roll rule):
	now the attack strength is a roll of the dice;
	say "[italic type]Rolling ", the attack strength, "[run paragraph on]".
The alternative attack roll rule is listed instead of the standard attack roll rule in the attack modifier rules.

To decide which number is a roll of the dice:
	let n be a random number between 1 and 7;
	let m be a random number between 0 and 3;
	let x be n + m;
	if x is 10:
		if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
			now x is 20;
	decide on x.

[1: 1/28
2: 2/28
3: 3/28
4-7: 4/28
8: 3/28
9: 2/28
10: 1/28]
