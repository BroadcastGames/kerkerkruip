Use authorial modesty.

Section - The dream kind

A dream is a kind of object. A dream can be dreamt or undreamt. A dream is usually undreamt. [Dreamt once dream.]
A dream can be redreamable. A dream is usually not redreamable. [Redreamable dreams can be dreamt more than once.]

Dreamable test boolean is a truth state that varies.

A dream has a rule called the dreamable rule.
The dreamable rule of a dream is usually the simple dreamable rule.

This is the simple dreamable rule:

To decide whether (potential dream - a dream) is dreamable:
	if potential dream is dreamt and potential dream is not redreamable:
		decide on false;

		decide on dreamable test boolean.

A dream has a rule called the start the dream rule.

[But not "only for testing", because I reference it below.]
