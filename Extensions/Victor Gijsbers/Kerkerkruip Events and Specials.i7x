Instead of digging in Elemental Plane of Smoke:
	take no time;
	say "You cannot dig tunnels in the smoke.".
	
A teleport impossible rule (this is the no teleportation in elemental plane of smoke rule):
	if the location of the test subject is elemental plane of smoke:
		rule succeeds.	

Instead of going in Elemental Plane of Smoke when the player can move:
	now concentration of the player is 0;
	repeat with item running through things in Elemental Plane of Smoke:
		unless item is a person or item is a backdrop:
			move item to Elemental Plane of Smoke Storage.;

The map-label of Elemental Plane of Smoke is Figure of map_label_Smoke.






Chapter - Arena of the Fallen

The Arena of the Fallen is an arena. "The ruins of a formerly great arena. The ground is littered with remains, and there is definitely something unholy about this place.

Chapter - Arena of the Gods

The Arena of the Gods is an arena. "The divine Arena; a plaything for the Gods, too numb to fight on their own, to let their Chosen Ones fight it out.

	now Godfightname1 is the printed name of entry 1 of L;
	now Godfightname2 is the printed name of entry 2 of L;
	let z be a text;
	now z is "[Godfightname1] triumphing over [Godfightname2]";
	decide on z.
	
Section - Incarnating 

Incarnating relates one monster (called the monsteravatar) to one god. The verb to incarnate (he incarnates, they incarnate, he incarnated, it is incarnated, it is incarnating) implies the incarnating relation.

	if the player does not worship a god:
		let x be a random number between 3 and 7;

	now the favour of guy is 9;

Section - Godly intervention
[For each God, I'll be implementing some form of godly intervention here based on Victor's divine interventions

Arena-turncounter is a number that varies. Arena-turncounter is -1.
OppHerm is a person that varies.
OppHermBonus is a number that varies. OppHermbonus is 0.

	increase m by 35;
	let x be the divine favour times 5;
	if x is greater than m:
		now m is 0;
	otherwise:

	if a random chance of m in 100 succeeds:
		if at least one alive monster is enclosed by the Arena of the Gods:
			Let the supplicant be a random alive monster enclosed by the Arena of the Gods;

			If the benefactor is:
				-- Aite:

	if (the Arena-turncounter is greater than 0) and (the global defender is oppHerm) and (the location is the Arena of the Gods):
		if the numbers boolean is true, say " - [oppHermBonus] (Herm's blur bonus) [run paragraph on]";
