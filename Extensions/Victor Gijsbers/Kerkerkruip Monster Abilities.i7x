Part - Types and factions

Chapter - Basic attributes

A monster is usually hostile.
A monster is usually neuter.


Chapter - Monster types

Creature-type is a kind of value. The creature-types are living, undead, demonic, horrific.

A person has a creature-type. The creature-type of a person is usually living.

Status rule (this is the undead status rule):
	if the player is undead:
		if long status is true:
			say "You are [bold type]undead[roman type]: other undead are your allies; other potential allies may be your enemies instead; absorbing a soul may heal you only partially.[line break][run paragraph on]";


Chapter - New factions

[Undead attack everyone, except for other undead. Horrors attack everyone. Demonic doesn't hate demonic or hostile.]

undead-faction is a faction.
horrific-faction is a faction.
mindslug-enslaved is a faction.
player-enslaved is a faction.
insane is a faction.

Definition: a person is enslaved if its faction is mindslug-enslaved or its faction is player-enslaved.

When play begins (this is the set factions rule):
	now mindslug-enslaved hates friendly;
	now friendly hates mindslug-enslaved;
	repeat with X running through factions:
		now horrific-faction hates X;
		now X hates horrific-faction;
		now insane hates X;
		now X hates insane;
		unless X is undead-faction:
			now undead-faction hates X;
			now X hates undead-faction;
		if friendly hates X:
			now player-enslaved hates X;
		if X hates friendly:
			now X hates player-enslaved.

[And now some stuff we need because horrors might attack themselves.]

The standard hate rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Hate rule (this is the nonstandard hate rule):
	if the player is friendly and at least one hostile alive person is enclosed by the location:
		if friendly hates hostile:
			rule succeeds; [This is only here for speed. It is the most common case where we decide yes.]
	repeat with X running through alive not passive persons enclosed by the location:
		repeat with Y running through alive persons enclosed by the location:
			if the faction of X hates the faction of Y and X is not Y:
				rule succeeds;
	rule fails.

[An AI target selection rule for a person (called target) (this is the do not target yourself rule):
	if target is the running AI:
		decrease the Weight entry by 2000.]

Every turn when the player is undead (this is the undead follow undead rule):
	repeat with guy running through undead not follower persons in the location:
		now guy is follower;
		if follower percentile chance of guy is less than 50:
			now follower percentile chance of guy is 50.

Part - Abilities

Chapter - Healing

[This is an action that monsters can take.]

Healing is an action applying to nothing. [Obviously, it will apply to someone, but our simple AI cannot handle it that way.]

A person has a number called the heal power. The heal power of a person is usually 0.
A person has a number called the heal cooldown. The heal cooldown of a person is usually 3.
A person has a number called the current heal cooldown. The current heal cooldown of a person is usually 0.
			
First AI action selection rule for a person (called P) (this is the consider healing rule):
	if the heal power of P is greater than 0 and the current heal cooldown of P is less than 1:
		let someone needs healing be false;
		let greatest injury be 0;
		repeat with X running through alive persons enclosed by the location not opposed by P:
			let injury be permanent health of X minus health of X; 
			if injury is greater than 0:
				now someone needs healing is true;
				if greatest injury is less than injury:
					now greatest injury is injury;
		if someone needs healing is true:
			if greatest injury is greater than heal power of the running AI:
				now greatest injury is heal power of the running AI; [now m becomes the maximum amount of damage the global attacker can heal]
			choose a blank Row in the Table of AI Action Options;
			now the Option entry is the action of P healing;
			now the Action Weight entry is 5 plus greatest injury;

Carry out an actor healing:

	let chosen one be the actor;
	repeat with guy running through alive persons enclosed by the location:
		if the faction of guy does not hate the faction of the actor and guy is not the actor:
			let n be permanent health of guy minus health of guy; 
			if n is greater than 0:
				if m is less than n:
					now chosen one is guy;

	if m is greater than heal power of the actor:
		now m is heal power of the actor;
	say "[The actor] casts a spell of magical healing on [the chosen one], removing [m] points of damage.";
	heal chosen one for m health;
	now current heal cooldown of the actor is heal cooldown of the actor. 

Every turn (this is the reduce heal cooldown of the main actor rule):
	if the current heal cooldown of the main actor is greater than 0:
		decrease the current heal cooldown of the main actor by 1.


Chapter - Teleportation

[As a monster action.]

Teleporting is an action applying to nothing.

A person has a number called the teleport amount. The teleport amount of a person is usually 0. [Number of times the monster can teleport. -1 means infinitely.]
A person has a number called the teleport eagerness. The teleport eagerness of a person is usually 10. [percentage chance of serious consideration]
A person can be a spontaneous teleporter. A person is usually not a spontaneous teleporter. [A spontaneous teleporter will also teleport when the player is not present. Best used with a teleport amount of -1.]

A room can be teleportable. A room is usually teleportable. [A teleportable room is one you can teleport TO.]

[We have teleport rules which check whether a person can teleport.]
The teleport impossible rules are a rulebook.

To decide whether teleportation is impossible for (guy - a person):
	now test subject is guy;
	consider the teleport impossible rules;
	if rule succeeded:
		decide yes;
	otherwise:
		decide no.

A teleport impossible rule (this is the no teleportation outside the dungeon rule):
	if test subject is off-stage:
		rule succeeds;
	otherwise if x-coordinate of (the location of the test subject) is 100:
		rule succeeds.

[Finally, it need not be obvious to a person that teleportation is impossible. If a person is a teleport impossible aware, he does.]
A person can be teleport impossible aware. A person is usually not teleport impossible aware.

[ The teleporting action ]

Teleportation-destination is a room that varies.
Teleportation-from is a room that varies.

Setting action variables for teleporting:
	now teleportation-from is the location of the actor; [see teleportation Event]

Check an actor teleporting (this is the teleport impossible rule):
	if teleportation is impossible for the actor:
		now the actor is teleport impossible aware;
		if the actor is visible:
			say "[The actor] tries to teleport away, but something makes this impossible!" instead;
		otherwise:
			do nothing instead.

First carry out an actor teleporting (this is the choose a destination rule):
	let destination be a random placed placeable teleportable room;
	while destination is the location of the actor:
		let destination be a random placed placeable teleportable room;
	now teleportation-destination is destination;

Last carry out an actor teleporting (this is the actually do the teleportation rule):
	move actor to teleportation-destination;
	now concentration of actor is 0;
	unless teleport amount of actor is -1 or teleport amount of actor is 0:
		decrease teleport amount of actor by 1;
	unless teleportation-from is the location and teleportation-destination is the location:
		clean the table of delayed actions for the actor;

Report an npc teleporting:
	if teleportation-from is the location and teleportation-destination is the location:
		say "[The actor] teleport[s] away, but reappear[s] in the exact same spot.";
	otherwise:
		if teleportation-from is the location:
			say "[The actor] suddenly teleport[s] away!";
		if  teleportation-destination is the location:
			say "[The actor] suddenly teleport[s] into the room!";


To teleport the player:
	say "A sickening feeling, and then you find yourself in --[paragraph break]";
	try the player teleporting;
	now retreat location is teleportation-destination;
	consider the sudden combat reset rules;
	now the take no time boolean is false;


[AI rules]

First AI action selection rule for an at-Act person (called P) (this is the consider teleporting rule):
	choose a blank Row in the Table of AI Action Options;
	now the Option entry is the action of P teleporting;
	if the teleport amount of P is 0:
		now the Action Weight entry is -1000;
	otherwise:
		if P is teleport impossible aware:
			now the Action Weight entry is -100;
		otherwise:
			now the Action Weight entry is -20.

An AI action selection rule for an at-Act person (called P) (this is the teleport eagerness rule):
	let n be the teleport eagerness of P;
	if a random chance of n in 100 succeeds:
		choose row with an Option of the action of P teleporting in the Table of AI Action Options;
		increase the Action Weight entry by 35.

Every turn (this is the spontaneous teleport rule):
	repeat with guy running through spontaneous teleporter not off-stage persons:
		if teleport amount of guy is not 0:
			let n be the teleport eagerness of guy;
			if a random chance of n in 100 succeeds:
				try guy teleporting. 

Every turn (this is the teleport impossible awareness expires rule):
	repeat with guy running through teleport impossible aware persons:
		unless teleportation is impossible for guy:
			now guy is not teleport impossible aware.


Chapter - Ray of disintegration

[Our implementation is simple in the sense that the AI has no preference for destroying one object over another. Making this more interesting would be a good project for the future.]

Disintegrating is an action applying to nothing.

A person has a number called the disintegrate power. The disintegrate power of a person is usually 0.
A person has a number called the disintegrate cooldown. The disintegrate cooldown of a person is usually 5.
A person has a number called the current disintegrate cooldown. The current disintegrate cooldown of a person is usually 0.
		
First AI action selection rule for a person (called P) (this is the consider disintegrating rule):
	if the disintegrate power of P is greater than 0 and the current disintegrate cooldown of the P is less than 1:
		repeat with guy running through alive persons enclosed by the location opposed by P:
			if guy has at least one[ corruptible] thing:
				choose a blank Row in the Table of AI Action Options;
				now the Option entry is the action of P disintegrating;
				now the Action Weight entry is disintegrate power of P;
				if a random chance of 1 in 10 succeeds:
					increase Action Weight entry by 10;
				stop;

Carry out an actor disintegrating (this is the standard disintegrate rule):
	let boolean be false;
	let guy be the actor;
	let item be the non-thing;
	while boolean is false:
		now guy is a random alive person enclosed by the location;
		if the actor opposes the guy:
			if guy has at least one[ corruptible] thing:
				now item is a random[ corruptible] thing had by guy;
				now boolean is true;
	let n be the disintegrate power of the actor;
	if item is minor or item is non-treasure:
		now n is n times 6;
	if item is major:
		now n is n times 4;
	if item is epic:
		now n is n times 2;
	if item is incorruptible:
		now n is 0;
	if a random chance of n in 100 succeeds:
		say "[The actor] casts a ray of disintegration at [the item], destroying the object!";
		remove item from play;
		ready natural weapons;
	otherwise:
		say "[The actor] casts a ray of disintegration at [the item], but the object resists!";
	now current disintegrate cooldown of the actor is disintegrate cooldown of the actor.

Every turn (this is the reduce disintegrate cooldown of the main actor rule):
	if the current disintegrate cooldown of the main actor is greater than 0:
		decrease the current disintegrate cooldown of the main actor by 1.
