Chapter - Rules for placement


Section - Valuation

Valuation is a kind of value. The valuations are minor, major, epic, unique, special and non-treasure.
[The number of treasures of each valuation which is placed is set at the end of Dungeon Generation.]
[Valuation also determines how far from Entrance Hall a treasure will generally be found.]

A thing has a valuation. A thing is usually non-treasure.

A treasure scoring rule (this is the better treasures farther away rule):
	if considered treasure is major:
		increase current room score by distance of considered room;
	if considered treasure is epic:
		increase current room score by two times distance of considered room;
	if considered treasure is special:
		increase current room score by two times distance of considered room.

The verb to value (it values, they value, it is valuing) implies the valuation property.

A treasure scoring rule (this is the mood rule):
	if mood of considered treasure is mood of considered room:

Chapter - Special kinds of treasure
		
Section - Treasure Packs

[Suppose we want to put three potions of X together as a treasure. First, we probably don't want to make all tokens of a type into placeable treasures. Second, how do we get three together? The solution to both is the treasure pack: a dummy item that gets placed, and is then turned into whatever it contains.]

A treasure pack is a kind of container.

Dungeon finish rule (this is the remove treasure packs rule):
	repeat with item running through treasure packs:
		if item is not off-stage:
			let X be a random thing that contains item;
			if the location of item contains item, let X be the location of item; 
			repeat with Y running through things contained by item:
				move Y to X;
			remove item from play.

Snorting is an action applying to one carried thing. Understand "snort [thing]" and "sniff [thing]" as snorting. Understand "use [package of ment]" as snorting.

Check snorting:
	if the noun is an essence:
		try inhaling the noun instead;
	otherwise:
		if the noun is not a package of ment:
			take no time;
			say "You cannot snort that." instead.

Check snorting a package of ment when the combat status is not peace:
	unless player is hidden:
		take no time;
		say "There is absolutely no way you could pull that off in a combat situation. The ment would get spilled everywhere." instead.

Carry out snorting a package of ment:
	if the ment addiction is 0 or at least three packages of ment are on-stage:
		say "You take a small mirror, a razor and a straw from one of your pockets, and carefully cut the ment on the surface of the mirror. The light blue powder is looking very good. Using the straw, you manage to get almost all of it in your nose. You inhale sharply a few times -- and feel the ment do its awesome work.[paragraph break]Everything becomes clear, sharp, easy. You feel strong. You feel focused.";
	otherwise:
		say "You repeat the ritual: cutting, forming into a line, snorting through the straw, inhaling sharply. The ment kicks in immediately.";
	have the ment kick in.

To have the ment kick in:
	increase the ment addiction by 1;
	[unless ment timer is 0:
		if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
			if the OD timer is 0:
				now the OD timer is 12;
			otherwise:
				end the game saying "You OD'ed.";]
	now the ment timer is a random number between 10 and 15;
	remove the noun from play.
	


Status rule (this is the ment status rule):
	if ment timer is greater than 0:
		say "You are under the influence of [bold type]ment[roman type]: +[ment bonus] attack, +[ment bonus] damage, -[ment bonus] enemy damage, +[ment bonus] defence, +[ment bonus] to all abilities.[line break][run paragraph on]";
	if ment timer is 0 and ment addiction is greater than 0:
		say "You feel [bold type]down[roman type]: -[ment addiction] attack, -[ment addiction] to all abilities[line break][run paragraph on]".

Instead of eating a package of ment (this is the ment cannot be eaten rule):
	take no time;
	say "Ment has to be taken through the nose, not the mouth. Try snorting it.".
