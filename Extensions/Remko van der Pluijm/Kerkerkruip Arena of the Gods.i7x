Godfightame1 is a text that varies.
Godfightame2 is a text that varies.


To decide which text is the random fight text:
	Let L be a list of objects;
	repeat with g running through gods:
		if (the player does not worship g) and (there is a monster incarnating g):
			add the monsteravatar of g to L;
	sort L in random order;
	now Godfightame1 is the printed name of entry 1 of L;
	now Godfightame2 is the printed name of entry 2 of L;
	let z be a text;
	now z is "[Godfightame1] triumphing over [Godfightame2]";
	decide on z.
	
	

The Godfight boolean is a truth state variable that varies. The Godfight boolean is false.

Chosenname is a text that varies.
Godname is a text that varies.
Chosenlijst is a list of monsters that varies.

Instead of entering the godfight pedestal:
	try ChosenFighting instead.

Carry out ChosenFighting:
	if the player worships a god:
		if the Godfight boolean is false:
			if the location is the Hall of Gods:
				take no time;
				now Chosenlijst is {};
				now Godlijst is {};
				now current question is  "The Chosen One of which god do you wish to fight? (Please enter a number):";
				repeat with Godnaam running through gods:
					unless player worships Godnaam:
						if Godnaam is incarnated by a monster:
							if ((monsteravatar of Godnaam) is off-stage) and ((monsteravatar of Godnaam) is not dead):
								add (monsteravatar of Godnaam) to Chosenlijst;
								add the printed name of Godnaam to Godlijst;
				add "do not fight a Chosen One" to Godlijst;
				now current question menu is Godlijst;
				ask a closed question, in menu mode;
		otherwise:
			say "You have already fought for the honour of [a random god worshipped by the player]!  [If a random god worshipped by the player is female]She[else]He[end if] isn't willing to sit through another fight again.";
			take no time;
	otherwise:
		let x be a random number between 5 and 10;
		decrease the health of the player by x;
		say "A roaring voice answers your call:'YOU CANNOT DEFEND ANY HEATHEN RELIGION YOU MIGHT WORSHIP AT THIS HOLY PLACE, INFIDEL!' A ball of lightning shoots from the sky, doing [x] damage to you!";
		if the health of the player is less than 1:
			end the story saying "The Gods do not appreciate heathen worship. The dvine ball of lighting deprives you of your live.".
		
A menu question rule (this is the ChosenFighting rule):
	if the current question is "The Chosen One of which god do you wish to fight? (Please enter a number):":
		let n be the number of entries in Godlijst;
		let m be the number understood;
		if m > 0:
			if m < n:
				Let Pers be entry m of Chosenlijst;
				if Pers is group leading and Pers is not defeated individually:
					move Pers to the Arena-waiting-room;
					now chosenname is the printed name of Pers;
					now Godname is entry m of Godlijst;
					if Pers is initially accompanied:
						repeat with X running through people who accompany Pers:
							move X to the location of Pers;
					repeat with guy running through persons in the Arena-waiting-room:
						challenge guy;
						move guy to the Arena of the Gods;
						say "The heavy doors open, where the angry [guy] awaits, prepared to fight for the honour of [Godname]!";
					move the player to the Arena of the Gods;
					now the Godfight boolean is true;
				otherwise:
					now the chosenname is the printed name of Pers;
					challenge Pers;
					move Pers to the Arena of the Gods;
					say "The heavy doors open, where the angry [Pers] awaits, prepared to fight for the honour of [Godname]!";
					move the player to the Arena of the Gods;
					now the Godfight boolean is true;
			otherwise:
				say "You decide it is best to defend the honour of your God another time...".


Section - Godly intervention
[For each God, I'll be implementing some form of godly intervention here based on Victor's divine interventions
This system assumes that the divine favour of the monster is quite high and fixed; it then takes the difference 
between the monsters divine favour and the players and then checks whether the god will intervene for the monster]
Every turn when (the location is the Arena of the Gods) and (the combat status is not peace):
	let m be 30;
	decrease m by the divine favour;
	If a random chance of m in 100 succeeds:
		have Godname arena-intervene. 


Arena-turncounter is a number that varies. Arena-turncounter is -1.
OppNomos is a person that varies.
OppNomosDetermined is a truth state variable that varies. OppNomosDetermined is false.

To have (guy - a text) arena-intervene:

			increase n by a random number between 1 and 9;
			increase n by 5; [half of wrath state]
			if the Healer of Aite is alive:
				let X be the permanent health of the Healer of Aite;
			otherwise:
				let X be a random number between 16 and 23; [health average between the three fanatics]
			now X is X divided by 10;
			if a chance of the final spirit of the Healer of Aite in 50 succeeds:
				increase X by 2;
			Let Y be (X times 3) divided by 2;
			let opp be a random hostile alive person enclosed by the location;
			if n < 10:
				say "A gigantic [one of]sword[or]spear[or]pike[at random] bursts out of the ground, impaling [the opp] for [bold type][Y] damage[roman type]!";
				decrease the health of the opp by Y;
				unless guy is dead:
					let the opp lose concentration;
				if the health of the guy is less than 1:
					say "Clearly, it doesn't always pay off to serve the mad goddess.";
			otherwise if n < 20:

					say "You suddenly feel divinely inspired and [bold type]highly concentrated[roman type].";
					now the concentration of the player is 3;
			otherwise if n < 40:

					decrease the health of the player by X;
					unless the player is dead:
						let the player lose concentration;
					if the player is hidden:
						now the player is not hidden;
						say "Your cry of pain reveals your presence.";
					if health of the player is less than 1:
						end the story saying "A maddening laughter of the Goddess is the last sound you'll ever hear.";
			otherwise:

					increase Action Weight entry by 1000;
			If guy is "Sul":
			If guy is "Chton":
			If guy is "Herm":
			[Todo stuff].
